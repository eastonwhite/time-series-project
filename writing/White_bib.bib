abstract = {An analysis of the types of uncertainties faced by resource managers is presented. Uncertainties are classified by the frequency of occurrence. Managers develop ways for dealing with frequently occurring uncertainties that do not commonly present extraordinary problems. Uncertainties that occur infrequently require an adaptive learning approach to management where we must learn about the true states of nature by careful monitoring, evaluation, and experimentation. In an undesirable situation, the ability to respond rapidly is most important. Uncertainties that occur rarely, called surprise, are very difficult to deal with. Suggested responses include holding some resources in reserve to cope with the unexpected and developing broadly based monitoring systems to detect surprises as early as possible.},

The majority of our knowledge of harvested populations has been$\backslash$ndrawn from studies on single-species occupying continuous landscapes.$\backslash$nPopulation dynamics in spatially structured landscapes are markedly$\backslash$ndifferent from those in continuous habitats. We investigate the effects$\backslash$nof several harvesting strategies on the metapopulation dynamics of the$\backslash$nbruchid beetle Callosobruchus maculatus and its parasitoid$\backslash$nAnisopteromalus calandrae, when locally extinction prone populations of$\backslash$nbruchids were harvested. By harvesting the resource in this closed$\backslash$nresource-consumer interaction, we could examine the scenario where$\backslash$nhumans and natural predators share a common resource.$\backslash$n2. Using population-level models in single and coupled-patch systems,$\backslash$nsimulations were run to estimate sustainable harvesting levels for each$\backslash$nharvesting strategy. These harvesting levels were then implemented in$\backslash$nexperimental metapopulation microcosms. Experiments were run for$\backslash$nmultiple generations and long-term time series of population size and$\backslash$nharvest yield were collected.$\backslash$n3. Controversially, harvesting resulted in larger regional population$\backslash$nsizes in harvested metapopulations than in unharvested metapopulations.$\backslash$nSimilarly, conservative harvesting strategies such as fixed escapement$\backslash$nharvesting and harvesting with refuges resulted in smaller population$\backslash$nsizes than fixed quota or fixed proportion harvesting strategies. Fixed$\backslash$nproportion harvesting gave rise to the largest population sizes, fewest$\backslash$nlocal extinctions and largest yields. Assuming both species are of$\backslash$necological importance, fixed proportion is therefore the optimal$\backslash$nharvesting strategy for this model system.$\backslash$n4.

These results are of particular relevance both in the$\backslash$ndevelopment of sustainable harvesting policies in multi-species$\backslash$ncommunities or, conversely, the control of pest species inhabiting$\backslash$nspatially structured landscapes.

In this study the Beverton and Holt invariants were obtained from maximization of the fecundity function that optimizes the trade-off between survival and fecundity; this approach applies conventional fishery models and provides estimates of the constants C1, C2, and C3. These estimates can be compared with the estimates obtained by regression of 1/M on xm, M on K, and L(xm) on Linf across species and across populations within species. The values of the constants obtained from regression across species agree closely with the theoretical values of the constants. In fishery assessments, natural mortality is often approximated using growth parameters, and the analyses reported here indicate that the relations are not just statistical relations, but rather result from fundamental ecological relations among the parameters.},

abstract = {Diving with sharks, often in combination with food baiting/provisioning, has become an important product of today's recreational dive industry. Whereas the effects baiting/provisioning has on the behaviour and abundance of individual shark species are starting to become known, there is an almost complete lack of equivalent data from multi-species shark diving sites. In this study, changes in species composition and relative abundances were determined at the Shark Reef Marine Reserve, a multi-species shark feeding site in Fiji. Using direct observation sampling methods, eight species of sharks (bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, grey reef shark Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, whitetip reef shark Triaenodon obesus, blacktip reef shark Carcharhinus melanopterus, tawny nurse shark Nebrius ferrugineus, silvertip shark Carcharhinus albimarginatus, sicklefin lemon shark Negaprion acutidens, and tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) displayed inter-annual site fidelity between 2003 and 2012. Encounter rates and/or relative abundances of some species changed over time, overall resulting in more individuals (mostly C. leucas) of fewer species being encountered on average on shark feeding dives at the end of the study period. Differences in shark community composition between the years 2004-2006 and 2007-2012 were evident, mostly because N. ferrugineus, C. albimarginatus and N. acutidens were much more abundant in 2004-2006 and very rare in the period of 2007-2012. Two explanations are offered for the observed changes in relative abundances over time, namely inter-specific interactions and operator-specific feeding protocols. Both, possibly in combination, are suggested to be important determinants of species composition and encounter rates, and relative abundances at this shark provisioning site in Fiji. This study, which includes the most species from a spatially confined shark provisioning site to date, suggests that long-term provisioning may result in competitive exclusion among shark species.},
annote = {The effect of shark provisioning dive operations on elasmobranch community structure is not well known. In Fiji, a particular baited shark feeding site (Shark Reef Marine Reserve) sees up to eight species of sharks. A single dive company has conducted trips to the site 3-4 times a week, since 2003. Over the course of the study, more individuals of fewer species were seen. The authors suggest that either inter-specific interactions among species or operator-specific feeding protocals may be the reasons for this. The paper suggests that C. leucas excluded the smaller reef sharks from the provisoining site. Strong seasonal trends were also seen for most species. 


Paper discusses a number of important points for comparing to Cocos:
-increase of larger species compared to small species
-some species are migratory while others are not
-strong seasonal trends
-change in elasmobranch community assemblage

Clarke et al found that at a baited dive site, silky sharks increased significantly while grey reef sharks saw a large decline. Shortly therafter, silky sharks also declined.},

Our understanding of these movements has been enhanced by new technologies that now allow us to follow their movements over great distances and long time periods in great detail. This technology provides not only detailed information on the movements of a wide variety of marine species, but also detailed characteristics of the habitats they use and clues to their navigation abilities. Advances in electronic tracking technologies have been coupled with rapid development of statistical and analytical techniques. With these developments, conservation of highly migratory species has been aided by providing new information on where uncommon or endangered species go, what behaviors they perform and why, which habitats are critical, and where they range, as well as, in many cases, better estimates of their population size and the interconnectedness of subpopulations. Together these tools are providing critical insights into the ecology of highly pelagic marine vertebrates that are key for their conservation and management.},

abstract = {Recent advances in stochastic demography provide unique insights into the probable effects of increasing environmental variability on population dynamics, and these insights can be substantially different compared with those from deterministic models. Stochastic variation in structured population models influences estimates of population growth rate, persistence and resilience, which ultimately can alter community composition, species interactions, distributions and harvesting. Here, we discuss how understanding these demographic consequences of environmental variation will have applications for anticipating changes in populations resulting from anthropogenic activities that affect the variance in vital rates. We also highlight new tools for anticipating the consequences of the magnitude and temporal patterning of environmental variability.},
annote = {Ecological systems are inheritantly full of demographic and enironmental stochastiticty. However, models often only look at constant values for demographic parameters that do not change over time. These parameters can be allowed to change with time as the enironment changes. Allowing these parameters to vary with time can have a strong influence on population growth rates and persistence. 




The authors define stochastic demography as the study of stage-structured models where the environment is determined by some random process. 




I don't find it all that surprising that population dynamics in a temporally varying environment may be different than in a constant environment. However, I disagree that deterministic models cannot tell us anything. If models are too complicated (e.g. lots of stochastic elements), we cannot learn very much about the theory as well. In addition, stochastic models require the estimation of a lot more parameters.




I do agree that the role of variability is important when discussing how global climate change will affect populations. How populations will respond to global change depends on our understandings of a long link of important concepts: have to know what the climate will do, how vital rates of populations are affected by changes in the environment, and changing vital rates then affects population persisistence and growth rates. It will take a lot of effort to get at each piece in this puzzle.},

Concerned primarily with the size and the habitat distribution of populations, Professor Fretwell develops simple models that, when applied to specific populations, usually of birds, demonstrate the effect of seasonal variations on the regulation of populations. He maintains that seasonality, as a concept, is essential to a full understanding of environmental interaction.

abstract = {Many Caribbean coral reefs are undergoing a phase shift from coral to macroalgal dominance. Understanding the processes driving changes in algal abundance and community structure requires clarification of the relative effects of top-down (e.g., herbivory) and bottom-up processes (e.g., light, temperature, and nutrients). To date, a number of studies have examined the relative effects of grazing versus nutrification but interactions between herbivory and natural, seasonal fluctuations in temperature and light have not been investigated. This study considered the dynamics of three Caribbean macroalgal species [Lobophora variegata (Lamouroux), Dictyota pulchella (H{\"{o}}rnig and Schnetter), and Halimeda opuntia (Linnaeus)] and algal turf. A field experiment was established to measure species-specific algal dynamics (changes in abundance) over 13 months in the presence and absence of herbivory. Both herbivory and seasonal changes were important processes controlling macroalgal and turf abundance. Water temperature and light had a key role on D. pulchella; this species' abundance significantly increased in the summer, when water temperature and light were the highest, and decreased during winter. Surprisingly, herbivory did not seem to control D. pulchella directly. However, herbivory was the most important process controlling the abundance of L. variegata, H. opuntia, and turf. The abundance of both algal species was correlated with seasonal changes in the environment, but was depleted outside cages throughout the year. The abundance of H. opuntia was positively correlated with temperature and light, but there was no statistical interaction between drivers. The statistical interaction between temperature and light was significant for the abundance of L. variegata and turf, but algal abundance declined as both factors increased. Overall, macroalgal and turf cover were mainly controlled by herbivory, while community structure (which species contributed to the overall cover) was largely influenced by seasonal changes in temperature and light.},

abstract = {The natural mortality of exploited fish populations is often assumed to be a species- specific constant independent of body size. This assumption has important implica- tions for size-based fish population models and for predicting the outcome of size- dependent fisheries management measures such as mesh-size regulations. To test the assumption, we critically review the empirical estimates of the natural mortality, M (year)1), of marine and brackish water fish stocks and model them as a function of von Bertalanffy growth parameters, L (cm) and K (year)1), temperature (Kelvin) and length, L (cm). Using the Arrhenius equation to describe the relationship between M and temperature, we find M to be significantly related to length, L and K, but not to temperature (R2 = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.0001, n = 168). Temperature and K are signif- icantly correlated and when K is removed from the model the temperature term becomes significant, but the resulting model explains less of the total variance (R2 = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.0001, n = 168). The relationships between M, L, L, K and temperature are shown to be in general accordance with previous theoretical and empirical investigations. We conclude that natural mortality is significantly related to length and growth characteristics and recommend to use the empirical formula: ln(M) = 0.55 ) 1.61ln(L) + 1.44ln(L) + ln(K), for estimating the natural mortality of marine and brackish water fish

annote = {It was once believed that extremely diverse ecosystems (e.g. rain forests and coral reefs) must also be near equilibrium and relatively stable. However, the frequency of disturbances (in particular at medium levels of disturbace, more notably the intermediate distrubtance hypothesis) and the time it takes to return to the pre-disturbed state suggest most systems are probably not at equilbrium. This has been shown in a variety of settings, most notetibly in studies of forest succession. Diversity from a dsisturbanes can relate to the frequency, intensity, or the amount of area affected. The equal chance hypothesis would assume that all species have an equal chance of colonizing a empty space. The gradual change hypothesis (as proposed by Hutchinson to explain plankton diversity) is that idea that the environment changes enough to where no species can really gain an edge on all other species. 

        
In support of equilibrium, a number of hypotheses have been proposed. The niche diversification hypothesis states that species are able to coexist because they are able to specialize to certain parts of a n-dimensional space. There is enough space for a lot of different species. A circular network could also maintain diversity if species acted as in a game of rock paper scissors. A compensatory mortality hypothesis would lead to a diverse system if the most competive species were also most strongly affected by some type of mortality. Those species couldn{\&}{\#}039;t really ever dominat than. },

abstract = {The tremendous increase in precipitation associated with the 1992-1993 El Nino profoundly affected terrestrial communities on and islands in the Midriff region of the Gulf of California. In 1992, winter precipitation was 5.4 times the historical mean, and winter precipitation over the entire El Nino was the highest two-year amount ever recorded. Increased precipitation led to an explosion of annual plant growth on the previously barren (0-4{\%} cover) islands: plant cover increased 10-160 times over what it had been. With the resumption of arid conditions in 1994, live plant cover returned to the low levels seen before the onset of El Nino. Insect abundance tracked this pulse in plant productivity and approximately doubled in 1992 and 1993 compared to 1991 levels. In 1994, the crash of annual plants caused insect densities to drop to the lowest levels recorded during the 5-yr study. El Nino also affected the composition of the insect assemblage. In the dry years 1990-1991, the assemblage was dominated by insects feeding on products originating in the ocean: detritivores/scavengers on shore drift of marine algae and carcasses, avian parasites, and detritivores of bird products. Herbivores were extremely rare. The heavy plant growth in 1992 stimulated large (40-190 times pre-El Nino levels) increases in herbivores. The great increases in land plant biomass and insect abundance are indicative of an important change in the dynamics of this system. Previously, most material flowing through the food webs of these islands originated directly or indirectly in the ocean. In contrast, during this El Nino, most material originated via productivity by terrestrial plants. Thus, wet El Ninos represent an agent that switches the system from one dependent primarily on allochthonous input to a system driven to a greater extent by in situ productivity. The influence of this pulse of terrestrial productivity extends beyond the El Nino years: the persistence and slow release of plant and detrital biomass reserves may also greatly affect dynamics for years after the El Nino event has passed. We suggest that large-scale climatic events such as El Nino may be long-lasting determinants of community dynamics rather than occasional disturbance events.},

abstract = {Background: Minimizing fishery bycatch threats might involve trade-offs between maintaining viable populations and economic benefits. Understanding these trade-offs can help managers reconcile conflicting goals. An example is a set of bycatch reduction measures for the Critically Endangered vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus), in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. The vaquita is an endemic species threatened with extinction by artisanal net bycatch within its limited range; in this area fisheries are the chief source of economic productivity.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyze trade-offs between conservation of the vaquita and fisheries, using an end- to-end Atlantis ecosystem model for the Northern Gulf of California. Atlantis is a spatially-explicit model intended as a strategic tool to test alternative management strategies. We simulated increasingly restrictive fisheries regulations contained in the vaquita conservation plan: implementing progressively larger spatial management areas that exclude gillnets, shrimp driftnets and introduce a fishing gear that has no vaquita bycatch. We found that only the most extensive spatial management scenarios recovered the vaquita population above the threshold necessary to downlist the species from Critically Endangered. The scenario that excludes existing net gear from the 2008 area of vaquita distribution led to moderate decrease in net present value (US 42 million) relative to the best-performing scenario and a two-fold increase in the abundance of adult vaquita over the course of 30 years.

Conclusions/Significance: Extended spatial management resulted in the highest recovery of the vaquita population. The economic cost of proposed management actions was unequally divided between fishing fleets; the loss of value from finfish gillnet fisheries was never recovered. Our analysis shows that managers will have to confront difficult trade-offs between management scenarios for vaquita conservation.},

abstract = {The role of learning in behaviour is well known for many animal taxa, including teleost fishes, insects, birds and mammals. However, its importance to sharks in everyday behavioural processes has rarely been considered. Almost 50 years ago the first learning experiments on sharks were conducted; our first section discusses these studies and places them in a framework of associative and non-associative learning. These experiments showed that sharks were capable of different forms of learning, such as operant and classical conditioning and habituation. Sharks could learn associations as rapidly as other vertebrates and also remember training regimes for several months. However, much of this experimental evidence was based on small sample sizes and few shark orders, such as Carcharhiniformes and Orectobliformes, leaving large gaps in our knowledge of the general learning capabilities of other shark orders. We also examine recent research that has tested for, or inferred learning in behavioural processes. This section reveals that sharks, like teleost fishes use learning to improve prey search and capture to potentially navigate and orientate in their home range and recognize conspecifics, heterospecifics and mates. Learning is also discussed in relation to ecotourism and fisheries. Findings indicated that these activities may lead to conditioning of sharks and that considerable effort should go into investigating what impact this could have on the shark species involved. Finally, we discuss the importance of combining laboratory experiments with field studies, the use of new experimental techniques, the role of model species and research priorities for future work.},

In the marine rocky intertidal this requisite usually is space. Where predators capable of preventing monopolies are missing, or are experimentally removed, the systems become less diverse. On a local scale, no relationship between latitude (10⚬ to 49⚬ N.) and diversity was found. On a geographic scale, an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higher-level carnivores.

We present an assessment of the current situation of the Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in Costa Rica, through an historical analysis, and an evaluation of their distribution, coverage and management categories. Costa Rica has 166 protected areas covering 50{\%} of the coastline; of these 20 are MPAs, classified as National Parks (90.6{\%}), National Wildlife Refuges (6.6{\%}), Wetlands (1.5{\%}), Biological Reserves (1{\%}), and one Absolute Natural Reserve (0.3{\%}).

The median distance between MPAs is 22.4km in the Pacific and 32.9km along the Caribbean. The median size is close to 54km2. The main threats to MPAs are the lack of coordination between governmental agencies, limited economic resources, restricted patrolling and control, poor watershed management, and rampant coastal alteration.

Pikas are small lagomorphs found in talus habitat of alpine areas throughout western North America. Adult pikas are individually territorial and rarely disperse. I used multilocus DNA fingerprinting to identify the parents ofjuvenile animait The settlement pattern of markedjuveniles and the pattern of relatedness of pikas across the study site was then examined within the study area. Although juveniles born at the study site exhibited a philopatric settlement pattern, an isolation-by-distance analysis did not reveal clusters of highly related individuals within the population. The Fn mim{\^{}}t* suggests little genetic differentiation between populations 2 km apart, and average DNA fingerprinting band-sharing among adults was similar to values reported for outbred spedes. An average of 34{\%} of the adult population was replaced each winter by immigrants. DNA fingerprinting band-sharing analysis suggests that these immigrants had dispersed short, intermediate, and long distances. These findings differ from earlier studies which used obser- vations of marked animals only to characterize dispersal patterns. Direct observations of marked juveniles had documented a philopatric settlement pattern, little or no dispersal out of natal populations, and no direct evidence of long distance movement. Of the three major hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of dispersal in birds and mammal{\^{}}, competition for resources, competition for mates, and inbreeding avoidance, the results of this study support a competition for resources hypothesis, where the key resource is territory.

abstract = {Environmental risk assessment and decision-making strategies over the last several decades have become increasingly more sophisticated, information-intensive, and complex, including such approaches as expert judgment, cost-benefit analysis, and toxicological risk assessment. One tool that has been used to support environmental decision-making is comparative risk assessment (CRA), but CRA lacks a structured method for arriving at an optimal project alternative. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides better-supported techniques for the comparison of project alternatives based on decision matrices, and it also provides structured methods for the incorporation of project stakeholders' opinions in the ranking of alternatives. We argue that the inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict ecosystem evolution and response to different management policies requires shifting from optimization-based management to an adaptive management paradigm. This paper brings together a multidisciplinary review of existing decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe and synthesizes state-of-the-art research in CRA, MCDA, and adaptive management methods applicable to environmental remediation and restoration projects. We propose a basic decision analytic framework that couples MCDA with adaptive management and its public participation and stakeholder value elicitation methods, and we demonstrate application of the framework to a realistic case study based on contaminated sediment management issues in the New York/New Jersey Harbor. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, measured dispersal curves are typically leptokurtic, not normal. In this paper, we consider a class of models, integrodifference equations, that directly incorporate detailed dispersal data as well as population growth dynamics. We provide explicit formulas for the speed of invasion for compensatory growth and for different choices of the propagule redistribution kernel and apply these formulas to the spread of D. pseudoobscura. We observe that: (1) the speed of invasion of a spreading population is extremely sensitive to the precise shape of the redistribution kernel and, in particular, to the tail of the distribution; (2) fat-tailed kernels can generate accelerating invasions rather than constant-speed travelling waves; (3) normal redistribution kernels (and by inference, many reaction-diffusion models) may grossly underestimate rates of spread of invading populations in comparison with models that incorporate more realistic leptokurtic distributions; and (4) the relative superiority of different redistribution kernels depends, in general, on the precise magnitude of the net reproductive rate. The addition of an Allee effect to an integrodifference equation may decrease the overall rate of spread. An Allee effect may also introduce a critical range; the population must surpass this spatial threshold in order to invade successfully. Fat-tailed kernels and Allee effects provide alternative explanations for the accelerating rates of spread observed for many invasions},

Overall, I enjoyed reading Taleb's, The Black Swan. It put a lot of my current research and thoughts into a broad framework. Taleb discussed several aspects of Black Swan, or rare and impactful events: health, finances, and in nature. He spends a lot of effort pushing back on people (especially financial analysts) who do not take rare events in account. He splits his thoughts into two main views: Mediocristan and Extremistan (page 36) The book is not very technical, but he occasionally dives into some probability theory. Since the book has been published he has apparently published several papers on the same topic. He certainly tended to get a bit repetitive and sometimes arrogant, but overall it was still a good read.  


There are a number of specific comments I highlighted in the book: 
pg. 14: shares view that taxi drivers and more educated people can predict to same ability, but taxi cab drivers don't pretend to know how to predict
pg. 27: discusses difference between scalable and non scalable professions. For example, a dentist is not scalable b/c it requires time, same with jobs paid by the hour. However, this type of work is also pretty predictable. You can get a steady stream of customers. Conversely, a writer or scientist is driven by “Black Swan” events that lead to lots of success
pg. 45: positive black swans take a long time to show there effects while negative black swans can have near instantaneous effects
pg. 53: often people separate work from personal lives. e.g. statisticians who cannot answer statistical questions not phrased as statistical questions
pg. 57: discusses Popper and falsifiability 
pg 61: argues that frequency of earthquakes has not changed much but our ability to handle these events has changed a lot
pg. 86: difficulty of working in science b/c an average day involves discovering nothing, which is important but still discouraging. A watch repairman may still fix watches each day
pg. 94: if you engage in such black swan work, it is best to be part of a group
pg. 146: physchology work on which fields whose experts are really experts
true for: livestock judges, chess master, mathematicians, accountants..
no experts for: stockbrokers, clinical psychologists, college admissions officers, intelligence analysts...
pg. 147: discusses evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers
pg. 179: Discusses Lorenz and chaos theory
pg. 183: rails against idea of tenured faculty as they shouldn't be ultimate owners of knowledge
pg. 184: argues that optimization is a form of sterile modeling 
pg. 204: to take advantage of rare positive events, you need to increase the serendipity around you
should also use a barbell strategy in life - be hyper conservative na dhyperagreesive 
have 85 percent in safe investments and 15 percent in black swan possibilities 
how does this relate to scientific research as well? Spend 15 percent of effort on crazy ideas perhaps?
have to take advtange of opportunities all the time to hope one pays off
pg 234: begins discusses power law distributions, 80/20 rule, 
pg. 257: Galileo wrote: The great book of Nature lies ever open before our eyes and the true philosophy is written in  it{\ldots} But we cannot read it unless we have first learned the language and the characters in which it is written{\ldots} It is written in mathematical language and the characters and triangles, circles, and other geometric figures.
pg 267: discusses difficulty in predicting in different directions of time. For example, it is very difficult to calculate the shape of an ice cube after it has melted
pg. 315: makes argument that large (or more complex) organisms should be hurt more by large shocks 
pg. 316: discusses the larger species density on smaller islands as evidence that Mother Nature does not like too much connectivity and globalization
Need redundancy to deal with black swans
pg 335: note about papers in last couple of years in scientific journals
pg. 350: “ the more remote the event, the less we can get empirical data (assuming generously that the future will resemble the past) and the more we need to rely on theory
pg. 355: “ there is no reliable way to compute small probabilities"
pg. 362: “The modelers' respond to black swan ideas: “We know all that. Nothing is perfect. The assumptions are reasonable. The assumptions don't matter. The assumptions are conservation. You can't prove the assumptions are wrong. WE're only doing what everybody else does. The decision-maker has to be better off with us than without us. The models aren't totally useless. You have to the best you can with the data. You have to make assumptions in order to make progress. You have to give the models the benefit of the doubt. What's the harm?"
pg. 365: four quadrants of payoffs - can use most statistics in one or two quadrants comfortably 
pg. 368: discusses how science is not set of to appreciate negative results. The incentives are not there. You need to strive to be the next Darwin or something
pg. 370: how to deal with the black swan quadrant
avoid optimization, learn to love redundancy 
pg. 374: 10 principles for a black swan robust socieity
let fragile things break early when they are small
no socialization of losses and privatization of gains

Chapter 1: Student's Prior Knowledge:
-There is often a mismatch between what students know and what professors expect them to know
-Prior knowledge, that is incorrect, can also hurt a student's ability to learn something new
-Therefore, student's prior knowledge ca either help or hinder learning
-Prior knowledge (that is accurate and relvent) can be leveraged by an instructor to allow students to make new connections, this allows them to learn and retain more information
-different types of knowledge
--declarative knowledge- knowledge of facts or concepts that can be stated
--procedural knowledge- knowing how and when to apply different procedures, theories, or styles
-difference between knowing what versus how or when- important for instructors to keep this in mind
-prior information, even when accurate, can hinder if it is not used in the correct context
-inaccruate information or misconceptions may make students less willing to accept to evidence
-a number of tools/approaches are available to overcome or use prior knowledge of students




Chapter 2 (Organizing knowledge):
-if you don't have a organizing structure for the material you are learning it impedes learning
-difficult to learn with many isolated facts
-need many connections between facts and ideas
-want to organize book or course according to a framework designed around your learning objectives
-Experts organize their knowledge according to a density of connections among different facts or skills
-{\textgreater} allows knowledge to be accessed and used more effiently 
-need to be able to recongnize meaningful patterns


-it can help a student if future problems if they can expalin how an already solved problem was derived
Strategies:
-create a concept map to organize your own knowledge
-ask students different types of tasks or questions to see how many ways they have organized the material
-provide students with the organizational structure of the course (and refer back to the material- could even go back to the same slide multiple times in the semester)
-can help to explain the deeper connections or relationships between ideas
-ask students to draw concept maps


Chapter 3 (Motivation in learning):
-students are not always motivated the same way as their professors
-two key components to motivation: 1) subjective value of a goal 2) expecations for success of that goal
-goals serve as a compass for actions and reasons for motivation or lack there of
-often a mismatch of goals for students versus professors expectations of them
-learning versus performance (grade) goals
-if an acitivty satisfies more than one goal-{\textgreater} may result in better motivation
-Value- a goal's importance (attainment value- satiffaction from mastery or accomplishment, intrinisic value- satisfaction one gains from simply doing a given task regardless of outcome, instrumental value- degree to which goal may help in accomplishing other important goals) 
-Expectancies- people want some idea that they can actually achieve the goals set forth for them
--e.g. Gould said if you work hard, you will get an A, he was right. Kostelich was also encouraging
--Need to believe you can do it (that is why early success is so important)
--it is also important to identify the reasons for past success of failures 
-Classroom has to be a supportive and approachable place for students to be motivated


-Three important components of motivation (value, expectations, the environment)
-Combinations of these three switches may work better or worse for different students, but you do need all three in order for students to have success


Strategies:
For adding value:
-connect material to students interests
-provide authentic, real-world tasks
-connect material to other courses or other material
-explain how a particular skill can help in a student's future profession (explain why writing ability is important in lab reports)
-identifiy and reward what you value as an instructor
-share you own passion and enthusiasm!!!!
For expectations:
-ensure alignment of objectives and assessements of those objectives
-need challenging but attainable goals
-tell your students your expectations of them
-provide feedback that is constructive
-desribe effective study strategies


-allow students to choose among many options (they can own it then)
-make sure students have chance to reflect},

abstract = {Adaptation in dynamic environments depends on the grain, magnitude and predictability of ecological fluctuations experienced within and across generations. Phenotypic plasticity is a well-studied mechanism in this regard, yet the potentially complex effects of stochastic environmental variation on optimal mean trait values are often overlooked. Using an optimality model inspired by timing of reproduction in great tits, we show that temporal variation affects not only optimal reaction norm slope, but also elevation. With increased environmental variation and an asymmetric relationship between fitness and breeding date, optimal timing shifts away from the side of the fitness curve with the steepest decline. In a relatively constant environment, the timing of the birds is matched with the seasonal food peak, but they become adaptively mismatched in environments with temporal variation in temperature whenever the fitness curve is asymmetric. Various processes affecting the survival of offspring and parents influence this asymmetry, which collectively determine the 'safest' strategy, i.e. whether females should breed before, on, or after the food peak in a variable environment. As climate change might affect the (co)variance of environmental variables as well as their averages, risk aversion may influence how species should shift their seasonal timing in a warming world.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool for unravelling the complex structure of food webs1±3. This technique is particularly well suited for studies at ecosystem boundaries, where physical processes and mobile consumers link the dynamics of seemingly disparate systems4±6. In coastal and insular environments, seabirds play a crucial role in transporting marine-based energy and nutrients to islands7±9. Here we show using stable isotopes that nutrients from the ocean drive the dynamics of terrestrial food webs on small islands. The indirect effects of seabird-derived nutrients on plant productivity are particularly prominent during wet El Nin{\"{A}}o Southern Oscillation years on our Gulf of California study sites. During dry years that characterize the region, many terrestrial consumers are subsidized by carrion and prey from the ocean. Shifts in trophic structure related to El Nin{\"{A}}o Southern Oscillation could only be elucidated because of the distinct nitrogen isotope ratios associated with seabird islands. The contributions of seabirds and other marine sources are re¯ected in the isotope signatures of terrestrial consumers in ways that challenge conventional interpretations of stable isotope results in studies of food webs.},

abstract = {We estimate recent (1992–2005) trends in relative abundance for Northwest Atlantic oceanic and large coastal sharks, using generalized linear mixed models to standardize catch rates of eight species groups as recorded by U.S. pelagic longline fishery observers. Models suggest precipitous (76{\%}) declines in ham- merhead (Sphyrna species) and large coastal (dusky, night, and silky shark, genus Carcharhinus) species, and moderate declines (53{\%}) in blue and oceanic whitetip sharks over this period. In contrast, mako and thresher sharks appear to have stabilized, and the tiger shark population appears to be increasing. A comparison of nominal shark catch rates from this fleet's observer and logbook data (to evaluate the veracity of trends previously estimated from the latter) showed a high degree of concordance for each species group, both in individual sub-areas and overall. Models of these two datasets for the common time period (1992–2000) show that compared to the observer data the logbook data indicate greater declines for some species, but lesser declines for others. Signs of recovery for some shark species are encouraging, but must also be set in the context of the significant declines that occurred in previous decades.},

abstract = {Two key linked questions in population dynamics are the relative importance of noise vs. density-dependent nonlinearities and the limits on temporal predictability of population abundance. We propose that childhood microparasitic infections, notably mea-sles, provide an unusually suitable empirical and theoretical test bed for addressing these issues. We base our analysis on a new mechanistic time series model for measles, the TSIR model, which captures the mechanistic essence of epidemic dynamics. The model, and parameter estimates based on short-term fits to prevaccination measles time series for 60 towns and cities in England and Wales, is introduced in a companion paper. Here, we explore how well the model predicts the long-term dynamics of measles and the balance between noise and determinism, as a function of population size. The TSIR model captures the basic dynamical features of the long-term pattern of measles epidemics in large cities remarkably well (based on time and frequency domain analyses). In particular, the model illustrates the impact of secular increases in birth rates, which cause a transition from biennial to annual dynamics. The model also captures the observed increase in epidemic irregularity with decreasing population size and the onset of local extinction below a critical community size. Decreased host population size is shown to be associated with an increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The interaction between nonlinearity and noise is explored using local Lyapunov exponents (LLE). These testify to the high level of stability of the biennial attractor in large cities. Irregularities are due to the limit cycle evolving with changing human birth rates and not due to complex dynamics. The geometry of the dynamics (sign and magnitude of the LLEs across phase space) is similar in the cities and the smaller urban areas. The qualitative difference in dynamics between small and large host communities is that demographic and extinction–recolonization stochasticities are much more influential in the former. The regional dynamics can therefore only be understood in terms of a core–satellite metapopulation structure for this host–enemy system. We also make a preliminary exploration of the model's ability to predict the dynamic consequences of measles vaccination.},

abstract = {1. Determininghowanimalsmovewithintheirenvironmentisafundamentalknowledgethatcon- tributes to effective management and conservation. Continuous `round-the-clock' animal move- ment data are frequently gathered using biotelemetry technology, providing discrete data packages on the presence--absence of animals at known locations through time. Current analyses of such data do not generally account for the interconnectivity of locations as animals move between them and consequently do not integrate graphically or statistically a temporal component to spatial changes.
2. Here, we describe the novel application of network analyses to electronic tag data whereby nodes represent locations and edges of the movements of individuals. We demonstrate some of the descriptive and quantitative approaches for determining how an animal's movement interconnects home range habitats. Telemetry data from arrays of recorders provide movement data of individ- ual animals, and as examples of the method proposed, we examine the movements of two distinct shark species, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). In doing so, we consider both local and global network properties from an animal movement perspective and simulate the effects of node disruption as a proxy for habitat disturbance.
3. Comparative visual representations of two catshark movement networks suggest, for example, potential differences in space use. Multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure shows that habitat is a significant predictor of movement behaviour.
4. Null modelling of C. perezi movement data, corrected for the spatial restriction of static nodes, demonstrated a significant, non-random distribution of directed movements among sites. Additionally, the connectivity of this animal's movement network is significantly reduced through targeted disruption of a site of high centrality but not through disruption of a randomly selected site.
5. Network theory is a well-established theoretical framework and its integration into the fast developing field of animal movement and telemetry might improve significantly how we interpret animal space use from electronically recorded data. This technique has potentially wide application in animal behaviour but may also inform the management of habitat harbouring threatened or endangered species via the simulation, modelling and intuitive visualisation of animal movement interactions.},

abstract = {Competition and disturbance are potent ecological forces that shape evolutionary trajectories. These forces typically work in opposition: when disturbance is infrequent, densities are high and competition is intense. In contrast, frequent disturbance creates a low-density environment in which competition is weak and good dispersal essential. We exploited recent advances in genomic research to quantify the response to selection by these powerful ecological forces at the phenotypic and molecular genetic level in experimental landscapes. We grew the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in discrete patches embedded in a hostile matrix and varied the number and size of patches and the intensity of disturbance, by creating both static and dynamic landscapes. In static landscapes all patches were undisturbed, whereas in dynamic landscapes all patches were destroyed in each generation, forcing seeds to disperse to new locations. We measured the resulting changes in phenotypic, genetic, and genotypic diversity after five generations of selection. Simulations revealed that the observed loss of genetic diversity dwarfed that expected under drift, with dramatic diversity loss, particularly from dynamic landscapes. In line with ecological theory, static landscapes favored good competitors; however, competitive ability was linked to growth rate and not, as expected, to seed mass. In dynamic landscapes, there was strong selection for increased dispersal ability in the form of increased inflorescence height and reduced seed mass. The most competitive genotypes were almost eliminated from highly disturbed landscapes, raising concern over the impact of increased levels of human-induced disturbance in natural landscapes.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2012) ABSTRACT: Forest trees are the dominant species in many parts of the world and predicting how they might respond to climate change is a vital global concern. Trees are capable of long-distance gene flow, which can promote adaptive evolution in novel environments by increasing genetic variation for fitness. It is unclear, however, if this can compensate for maladaptive effects of gene flow and for the long-generation times of trees. We critically review data on the extent of long-distance gene flow and summarise theory that allows us to predict evolutionary responses of trees to climate change. Estimates of long-distance gene flow based both on direct observations and on genetic methods provide evidence that genes can move over spatial scales larger than habitat shifts predicted under climate change within one generation. Both theoretical and empirical data suggest that the positive effects of gene flow on adaptation may dominate in many instances. The balance of positive to negative consequences of gene flow may, however, differ for leading edge, core and rear sections of forest distributions. We propose future experimental and theoretical research that would better integrate dispersal biology with evolutionary quantitative genetics and improve predictions of tree responses to climate change.},

Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density- and risk-driven ecological processes, and not demographic persistence alone.},

Characterization of genomic differentiation in a classic example of hybridization between all-black carrion crows and gray-coated hooded crows identified genome-wide introgression extending far beyond the morphological hybrid zone. Gene expression divergence was concentrated in pigmentation genes expressed in gray versus black feather follicles. Only a small number of narrow genomic islands exhibited resistance to gene flow. One prominent genomic region ({\textless}2 megabases) harbored 81 of all 82 fixed differences (of 8.4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in total) linking genes involved in pigmentation and in visual perception-a genomic signal reflecting color-mediated prezygotic isolation. Thus, localized genomic selection can cause marked heterogeneity in introgression landscapes while maintaining phenotypic divergence.},
annote = {Although species can seperate and gene flow can be stopped to generate speciation events, it is unclear how much gene flow is required. The black and gray crows of Europe are different in color and assortively mate according to color, but they still hybridize on occasion. By sequencing crows (for both their genomes and RNA to capture expression information) across Europe, researchers found evidence of substantial gene flow between black and gray crows. However, a small number (about 82 sites) has been fixed and appears to be unaffected even with high levels of gene flow. This just happens to be the region that encodes for pigmentation and visual acuity. The authors conclude that even with little differences (less than one percent) of genome between black and gray crows, this is enough to allow phenotypic differences. Assortitive mating and sexual selection, alone, can cause differentiation.

We conducted direct field observations of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris in a tidally influenced mangrove-inlet. We also used acoustic tracking to determine the movement patterns of juvenile lemon sharks and their predators (sub-adult lemon sharks) across the tidal cycle. Results showed that greater numbers of juvenile lemon sharks used the mangrove-inlet for longer time periods at deeper and warmer high tide depths. This coincided with an increased presence of potential predators (sub-adult lemon sharks) in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, in accordance with body-size dependent anti-predatory investment, smaller juvenile lemon sharks visited the mangrove inlet more often, spent longer there and left latest on average. Our acoustic tracking data also revealed a tidally-influenced pattern, with both juvenile and sub-adult lemon sharks detected at locations inshore over the high tide and offshore during the low tide. 

We concluded that the mangrove lake served as a refuge for juvenile lemon sharks over the high tide, providing safe habitat when inshore areas become accessible to large predators, such as sub-adult lemon sharks. We suggest that these decisions are updated through ontogeny and also with daily fluctuations in abiotic factors, such as water depth.

This study provides evidence for how intra-specific predator-prey interactions in a top predator species influence juvenile habitat selection

We show that persistence of such a population of connected subpopulations depends on whether the sum of the reproductive gains through all possible closed, between-patch reproductive paths through multiple generations, relative to the shortfall in self-persistence in each path, exceeds unity plus extra terms, which only appear if there are four or more patches. These extra terms have the heuristic explanation that they avoid double counting of reproductive paths that arise with four or more patches because there can be nonoverlapping subnetworks. Thus only those patterns of reproduction and connectivity which eventually lead to descendants returning to the patch from which they originate contribute to persistence. This result provides the basis for evaluating connectivity and habitat heterogeneity to understand reserve design, the effects of human fragmentation, the collapse of marine fisheries, and other conservation issues.},

abstract = {As a consequence of warming temperatures around the world, spring and autumn phenologies have been shifting, with corresponding changes in the length of the growing season. Our understanding of the spatial and interspecific variation of these changes, however, is limited. Not all species are responding similarly, and there is significant spatial variation in responses even within species. This spatial and interspecific variation complicates efforts to predict phenological responses to ongoing climate change, but must be incorporated in order to build reliable forecasts. Here, we use a long-term dataset (1953-2005) of plant phenological events in spring (flowering and leaf out) and autumn (leaf colouring and leaf fall) throughout Japan and South Korea to build forecasts that account for these sources of variability. Specifically, we used hierarchical models to incorporate the spatial variability in phenological responses to temperature to then forecast species' overall and site-specific responses to global warming. We found that for most species, spring phenology is advancing and autumn phenology is getting later, with the timing of events changing more quickly in autumn compared with the spring. Temporal trends and phenological responses to temperature in East Asia contrasted with results from comparable studies in Europe, where spring events are changing more rapidly than are autumn events. Our results emphasize the need to study multiple species at many sites to understand and forecast regional changes in phenology.},

abstract = {Permafrost contains an estimated 1672 Pg carbon (C), an amount roughly equivalent to the total currently contained within land plants and the atmosphere. This reservoir of C is vulnerable to decomposition as rising global temperatures cause the permafrost to thaw. During thaw, trapped organic matter may become more accessible for microbial degradation and result in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite recent advances in the use of molecular tools to study permafrost microbial communities, their response to thaw remains unclear. Here we use deep metagenomic sequencing to determine the impact of thaw on microbial phylogenetic and functional genes, and relate these data to measurements of methane emissions. Metagenomics, the direct sequencing of DNA from the environment, allows the examination of whole biochemical pathways and associated processes, as opposed to individual pieces of the metabolic puzzle. Our metagenome analyses reveal that during transition from a frozen to a thawed state there are rapid shifts in many microbial, phylogenetic and functional gene abundances and pathways. After one week of incubation at 5 °C, permafrost metagenomes converge to be more similar to each other than while they are frozen. We find that multiple genes involved in cycling of C and nitrogen shift rapidly during thaw. We also construct the first draft genome from a complex soil metagenome, which corresponds to a novel methanogen. Methane previously accumulated in permafrost is released during thaw and subsequently consumed by methanotrophic bacteria. Together these data point towards the importance of rapid cycling of methane and nitrogen in thawing permafrost.},

Here, we show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density) or individuals (rarefied species richness), the measured effect sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of sampling, as well as the size of the species pool. This compromises comparisons of effects sizes within studies using standard statistics, as well as among studies using meta-analysis. To derive an unambiguous effect size, we advocate that comparisons need to be made on a scale-independent metric, such as Hurlbert's Probability of Interspecific Encounter. Analyses of this metric can be used to disentangle the relative influence of changes in the absolute and relative abundances of individuals, as well as their intraspecific aggregations, in driving differences in biodiversity among communities. This and related approaches are necessary to achieve generality in understanding how biodiversity responds to ecological drivers and will necessitate a change in the way many ecologists collect and analyse their data.},

The effect of variability will almost cetaintly depend on the specific life history traits of a given population or species. Morris et al (2008) found that species with longer lifespans are more resiliant to variablity in the climate. This makes sense as they are able to endure good and bad years, where short-lived species depend on every year being good. Essentially, longetivity can be thought of as a evolutionary strategy to endure temporal variation in general. The authors found that life history traits are far more important in predicting species' response to changing climate than taxonomic relationshops. In addition, in local areas where climate variablity is expected to decrease, short-lived pests and bugs may actually have increased stochastic growth rates. Perhaps surprising, the elasticity of all the different vital rates was about the same. Also surprising, was that envionmental autocorrelation did not affect the elasticity of vital rates.

abstract = {The role of chromosomal inversions in adaptation and speciation is controversial. Historically, inversions were thought to contribute to these processes either by directly causing hybrid sterility or by facilitating the maintenance of co-adapted gene complexes. Because inversions suppress recombination when heterozygous, a recently proposed local adaptation mechanism predicts that they will spread if they capture alleles at multiple loci involved in divergent adaptation to contrasting environments. Many empirical studies have found inversion polymorphisms linked to putatively adaptive phenotypes or distributed along environmental clines. However, direct involvement of an inversion in local adaptation and consequent ecological reproductive isolation has not to our knowledge been demonstrated in nature. In this study, we discovered that a chromosomal inversion polymorphism is geographically widespread, and we test the extent to which it contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation under natural field conditions. Replicated crosses between the prezygotically reproductively isolated annual and perennial ecotypes of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, revealed that alternative chromosomal inversion arrangements are associated with life-history divergence over thousands of kilometers across North America. The inversion polymorphism affected adaptive flowering time divergence and other morphological traits in all replicated crosses between four pairs of annual and perennial populations. To determine if the inversion contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation in natural populations, we conducted a novel reciprocal transplant experiment involving outbred lines, where alternative arrangements of the inversion were reciprocally introgressed into the genetic backgrounds of each ecotype. Our results demonstrate for the first time in nature the contribution of an inversion to adaptation, an annual/perennial life-history shift, and multiple reproductive isolating barriers. These results are consistent with the local adaptation mechanism being responsible for the distribution of the two inversion arrangements across the geographic range of M. guttatus and that locally adaptive inversion effects contribute directly to reproductive isolation. Such a mechanism may be partially responsible for the observation that closely related species often differ by multiple chromosomal rearrangements.},

abstract = {California responded to concerns about overfishing in the 1990s by implementing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) through two science-based decision-making processes. The first process focused on the Channel Islands, and the second addressed California's entire coastline, pursuant to the state's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). We review the interaction between science and policy in both processes, and lessons learned. For the Channel Islands, scientists controversially recommended setting aside 30-50{\%} of coastline to protect marine ecosystems. For the MLPA, MPAs were intended to be ecologically connected in a network, so design guidelines included minimum size and maximum spacing of MPAs (based roughly on fish movement rates), an approach that also implicitly specified a minimum fraction of the coastline to be protected. As MPA science developed during the California processes, spatial population models were constructed to quantify how MPAs were affected by adult fish movement and larval dispersal, i.e., how population persistence within MPA networks depended on fishing outside the MPAs, and how fishery yields could either increase or decrease with MPA implementation, depending on fishery management. These newer quantitative methods added to, but did not supplant, the initial rule-of-thumb guidelines. In the future, similar spatial population models will allow more comprehensive evaluation of the integrated effects of MPAs and conventional fisheries management. By 2011, California had implemented 132 MPAs covering more than 15{\%} of its coastline, and now stands on the threshold of the most challenging step in this effort: monitoring and adaptive management to ensure ecosystem sustainability.},

abstract = {Marine planners use spatial data to assess planning options. They need analytical approaches, methods, applications and practical software tools to enable assessment of the relationships between human uses and ecosystem components. Here the results of a two-stage process, aimed at developing practical and GIS-based tools for direct use by planners, are presented. First, some available tools for use in the early stages of plan development were reviewed; for example, to identify interaction between activities to reduce potential conflicts or assist in zone delineation, methods to facilitate a risk assessment of the cumulative effect of human pressures and tools offering decision support. Second, a stakeholder workshop was organised to identify routine marine planning tasks and the technical tools required to support those tasks. From the 39 practical tools reviewed, mostly published in peer-reviewed literature between 1998 and 2009, the majority have been applied in the marine environment in Europe, USA and Australia. It was observed that many of the tools are designed to be used by scientists, programmers or strategic planners with only a few that could be used by case officers (regulators). Together with the results of the stakeholder workshop a suite of prototype tools were developed that offer utility to marine planners. Thus the developed tools provide a solid basis for future development as they are a result of a transparent and participatory process.},

abstract = {Collaborative environmental governance strategies seek to improve management efforts by involving nongovernmental stakeholders and spanning sectoral and geographic boundaries, but it is unclear whether government funding for such efforts efforts pays off in terms of improved environmental outcomes. This paper explores a common case of collaborative governance—collaborative watershed councils (WCs)—and examines whether the actions of collaborative WCs improve water quality. Coupling longitudinal data concerning 1984 grants given to local WCs in the state of Oregon with water quality monitoring data sampled at 161 sites, this analysis tests whether there is a prima facie case that the actions of local collaborative institutions improve environmental outcomes. Along with presenting some of the first evidence about the impacts of collaborative governance that is based on an objective outcome metric, this paper also contrasts different council actions and considers how institutional capacity impacts council efforts. WC actions are shown to be associated with improved water quality, but the magnitude of improvement is dependent on council attributes and the type of project for which funds are allocated. This paper also makes a methodological contribution by demonstrating the use of hierarchical Bayesian modeling to account for spatial and temporal dependencies present in observational data.},

abstract = {Marine megafauna such as seabirds, marine mammals and sea turtles are subject to high mortality from incidental capture or bycatch in fisheries. Recent research suggests that fishing effort is increasing worldwide, highlighting the need to evalu- ate strategies intended to reduce marine megafauna bycatch. Here, we use three focal species (i.e. leatherback turtle $\backslash$emph{\{}Dermochelys coriacea{\}}, black-footed albatross $\backslash$emph{\{}Phoebastria nigripes{\}} and vaquita porpoise $\backslash$emph{\{}Phocoena sinus{\}}) as case studies to compare management outcomes of four bycatch mitigation measures: time--area closures, individual bycatch limits, gear modifications and buy-outs. Time--area closures were used for leatherbacks and vaquitas with limited effectiveness, although timing, size and enforcement influenced their efficacy. Individual bycatch limits were employed for leatherbacks in one fishery, sometimes simulta- neously with gear modifications and closures. Gear modifications consistently reduced bycatch of leatherbacks and black-footed albatross and showed strong promise for vaquitas. True buy-outs were only used for vaquitas and were costly, most fishers were unwilling to be bought out, and it is unclear if they reduced bycatch. Our review suggests that gear modifications were the most widely used and generally most promising technique for these species, although management outcomes of each strategy depended largely on the species--fishery interaction, fishery characteristics and socioeconomic context. Based on lessons learned from our case studies, we outline when and where a particular approach may be most effective, provide recommendations for improving each strategy and highlight priorities for future research.},

abstract = {Several recent, high-impact ecological studies feature natural microcosms as tools for testing effects of fragmentation, metacommunity theory or links between biodiversity and ecosystem processes. These studies combine the microcosm advantages of small size, short generation times, contained structure and hierarchical spatial arrangement with advantages of field studies: natural environmental variance, 'openness' and realistic species combinations with shared evolutionary histories. This enables tests of theory pertaining to spatial and temporal dynamics, for example, the effects of neighboring communities on local diversity, or the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function. Using examples, we comment on the position of natural microcosms in the roster of ecological research strategies and tools. We conclude that natural microcosms are as versatile as artificial microcosms, but as complex and biologically realistic as other natural systems. Research to date combined with inherent attributes of natural microcosms make them strong candidate model systems for ecology.},

abstract = {Carcharhinid sharks can make up a large fraction of the top predators inhabiting tropical marine ecosystems and have declined in many regions due to intense fishing pressure. There is some support for the hypothesis that carcharhinid species that complete their life-cycle within coral reef ecosystems, hereafter referred to as "reef sharks", are more abundant inside no-take marine reserves due to a reduction in fishing pressure (i.e., they benefit from marine reserves). Key predictions of this hypothesis are that (a) individual reef sharks exhibit high site-fidelity to these protected areas and (b) their relative abundance will generally be higher in these areas compared to fished reefs. To test this hypothesis for the first time in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems we combined acoustic monitoring and baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to measure reef shark site-fidelity and relative abundance, respectively. We focused on the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), the most common reef shark in the Western Atlantic, at Glover's Reef Marine Reserve (GRMR), Belize. Acoustically tagged sharks (N = 34) were detected throughout the year at this location and exhibited strong site-fidelity. Shark presence or absence on 200 BRUVs deployed at GRMR and three other sites (another reserve site and two fished reefs) showed that the factor "marine reserve" had a significant positive effect on reef shark presence. We rejected environmental factors or site-environment interactions as predominant drivers of this pattern. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can benefit reef shark populations and we suggest new hypotheses to determine the underlying mechanism(s) involved: reduced fishing mortality or enhanced prey availability.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Theoretical models of coastal shark popu- lations have remained largely unchanged since the 1960s despite limitations in applicability to many spe- cies. Smaller bodied coastal species are poorly repre- sented by the current models. A new theoretical model is proposed to represent those species that spend most or all of their life within nearshore waters but do not show use of discrete nursery areas. Description of this new model outlines the importance of nearshore areas to these smaller species. While all coastal shark popu- lations are susceptible to environmental and anthro- pogenic impacts, species that fit the new model are more vulnerable to varying coastal processes, habitat degradation, and fishing pressure than are species that use nearshore areas for only part of their life-span. The dynamic nature of nearshore areas and their proximity to human populations present all sharks that occur in them with a range of advantages and disadvantages. This paper reviews how different species utilise near- shore areas and how they overcome the challenges they face in inhabiting these areas. Improving and ex- panding theoretical models of coastal shark popula- tions will provide a better understanding of how sharks use nearshore environments and assist in making con- servation and management decisions for these regions.},

The invasion process is highly stochastic, however, and the probability of success is generally low, even for advantageous alleles. Additionally, all organisms live in a stochastic environment, which may have a large influence on what alleles are favorable, but also contributes to the uncertainty of the invasion process. We calculate the invasion probability of a beneficial, mutant allele in a monomorphic, large population subject to stochastic environmental fluctuations, taking into account density- and frequency-dependent selection, stochastic population dynamics and temporal autocorrelation of the environment. We treat both discrete and continuous time population dynamics, and allow for overlapping generations in the continuous time case. The results can be generalized to diploid, sexually reproducing organisms embedded in communities of interacting species. We further use these results to derive an extended canonical equation of adaptive dynamics, predicting the rate of evolutionary change of a heritable trait on long evolutionary time scales.},

For Pisaster ochraceus from the San Juan Islands, South Puget Sound and Washington outer coast, time-series monitoring showed rapid disease spread, high mortality rates in 2014, and continuing levels of wasting in the survivors in 2015. Peak prevalence of disease at 16 sites ranged to 100{\%}, with an overall mean of 61{\%}. Analysis of longitudinal data showed disease risk was correlated with both size and temperature and resulted in shifts in population size structure; adult populations fell to one quarter of pre-outbreak abundances. In laboratory experiments, time between development of disease signs and death was influenced by temperature in adults but not juveniles and adult mortality was 18{\%} higher in the 19 degrees C treatment compared to the lower temperature treatments. While larger ochre stars developed disease signs sooner than juveniles, diseased juveniles died more quickly than diseased adults. Unusual 2-3 degrees C warm temperature anomalies were coincident with the summer 2014 mortalities. We suggest these warm waters could have increased the disease progression and mortality rates of SSWD in Washington State.},

abstract = {Whale sharks, Rhincodon typus, aggregate by the hundreds in a summer feeding area off the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, where the Gulf of Mexico meets the Caribbean Sea. The aggregation remains in the nutrient-rich waters off Isla Holbox, Isla Contoy and Isla Mujeres, Quintana Roo for several months in the summer and then dissipates between August and October. Little has been known about where these sharks come from or migrate to after they disperse. From 2003-2012, we used conventional visual tags, photo-identification, and satellite tags to characterize the basic population structure and large-scale horizontal movements of whale sharks that come to this feeding area off Mexico. The aggregation comprised sharks ranging 2.5-10.0 m in total length and included juveniles, subadults, and adults of both sexes, with a male-biased sex ratio (72{\%}). Individual sharks remained in the area for an estimated mean duration of 24-33 days with maximum residency up to about 6 months as determined by photo-identification. After leaving the feeding area the sharks showed horizontal movements in multiple directions throughout the Gulf of Mexico basin, the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and the Straits of Florida. Returns of individual sharks to the Quintana Roo feeding area in subsequent years were common, with some animals returning for six consecutive years. One female shark with an estimated total length of 7.5 m moved at least 7,213 km in 150 days, traveling through the northern Caribbean Sea and across the equator to the South Atlantic Ocean where her satellite tag popped up near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We hypothesize this journey to the open waters of the Mid-Atlantic was for reproductive purposes but alternative explanations are considered. The broad movements of whale sharks across multiple political boundaries corroborates genetics data supporting gene flow between geographically distinct areas and underscores the need for management and conservation strategies for this species on a global scale.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to genotyping based on multiplexed shotgun sequencing that can identify recombination breakpoints in a large number of individuals simultaneously at a resolution sufficient for most mapping purposes, such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and mapping of induced mutations. We first describe a simple library construction protocol that uses just 10 ng of genomic DNA per individual and makes the approach accessible to any laboratory with standard molecular biology equipment. Sequencing this library results in a large number of sequence reads widely distributed across the genomes of multiplexed bar-coded individuals. We develop a Hidden Markov Model to estimate ancestry at all genomic locations in all individuals using these data. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by mapping a dominant marker allele in D. simulans to within 105 kb of its true position using 96 F1-backcross individuals genotyped in a single lane on an Illumina Genome Analyzer. We further demonstrate the utility of our method by genetically mapping more than 400 previously unassembled D. simulans contigs to linkage groups and by evaluating the quality of targeted introgression lines. At this level of multiplexing and divergence between strains, our method allows estimation of recombination breakpoints to a median of 38-kb intervals.

This study was more of a methods paper than one that addressed specific scientific questions. With increasing technological capabilities genotyping has become easier and cheaper, but methods for the intermediate scales (100s-1000s of markers and individuals) have lacked behind. RAD tag approach and whole genome resequencing (WGR) are useful approaches, but require shearing DNA and therefore require a lot of DNA. This paper proposed a new method called "multiplexed shotgun genotyping" to overcome the limitations of RAD and WGR. This method uses a more frequent cutter enzyme that creates a large number of small reads. The paper multiplexes 96 individuals and show how accurate the method performs (less than 1{\%} error rate.. The method used a lot less DNA (only 10ng) and was a lot cheaper than typical methods. 






Technology:
Multiplexed shotgun sequencing is similar to RAD and WGR, but uses a more frequent cutter enzyme--producing many short fragments. These fragments are randomly scattered across the whole genome. Hidden Markov Models can then be used to stich these small reads back together with high accuracy. Sequencing of 96 indiviudals led to about 22 million 101-bp reads. This technology can do all of this with only 2 days of lab work. A lot less DNA is also needed which is important for many non-model organism studies. The authors also tested there method with more individuals, by resampling, and found the method to still be robust. In addition, they found that that multiplexing will also work for larger genomes, as they had only worked with Drosophila. There method does need an assembled genome for one individual to be effective. But this may be a small price to pay for all the results, for low cost, that are returned by multiplexed shotgun sequencing.},

Topics include animal hibernation, daily torpor, thermoregulation, heat production, metabolic depression, biochemical adaptations, neurophysiology and energy balance. The contributors to this book present interdisciplinary research at multiple levels ranging from the molecular to the ecophysiological, as well as evolutionary approaches. The chapters of this book provide original data not published elsewhere, which makes it the most up-to-date, comprehensive source of information on these fields. The book's subchapters correspond to presentations given at the 14th International Hibernation Symposium in August 2012 in Austria. This is a very successful series of symposia (held every four years since 1959) that attracts leading researchers in the field. Like the past symposia, this meeting – and consequently the book – is aimed not only at hibernation but at covering the full range of animal adaptations to seasonal environments. For the next four years, this book will serve as the cutting-edge reference work for graduate students and scientists active in this field of physiology and ecology..},

abstract = {Because seed dispersal influences the environment experienced by seeds, that environment can change as dispersal evolves. The evolutionary potential of dispersal can in turn change as dispersal evolves, if its expression of genetic variation depends on the postdispersal environment. We examined whether seed dispersion patterns have a detectable genetic basis (and therefore evolutionary potential) and determined whether that genetic basis changed depending on one postdispersal environmental factor: conspecific density. We grew replicates of 12 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana at high and low density and measured seed dispersion patterns and maternal traits associated with dispersal under controlled conditions. We found density-dependent ecotypic variation for maternal traits that influence dispersal. Significant genetic variation for postdispersal sibling density was detected only when plants were grown at high density, suggesting that if dispersal evolves to result in lower postdispersal densities, the expression of genetic variation for dispersal would be reduced. This dynamic could lead to a plasticity-induced constraint on the evolution of dispersal. The ability of organisms to alter the environment they experience and the ability of that environment to evolve can alter evolutionary dynamics by augmenting or reducing evolutionary potential and thereby facilitating or constraining evolutionary responses to selection.},

abstract = {Effective conservation requires rigorous baselines of pristine conditions to assess the impacts of human activities and to evaluate the efficacy of management. Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.},

Maladaptation to the new environment initially causes the population to decline, until adaptive phenotypic plasticity and genetic evolution restore positive population growth rate. We assume that selection on a quantitative trait is density-independent and that the initial cost of plasticity is much lower than the benefit of the initial plastic response. The initial partially adaptive plasticity reduces the effective magnitude of the environmental shift, whereas evolution of plasticity increases the rate of adaptation. Both effects greatly facilitate population persistence. In contrast, density dependence of population growth always hinders persistence. With theta-logistic population regulation, a lower value of theta produces a faster initial population decline and a higher extinction risk.},

The empirical literature has produced a number of simingly contradiciting results and no general trends. However, this may be due to more mechanistic factors. Many of these factors have been flushed out in the theoretical literature. The life history characterisitcs of the predator under question are of particular importance. Specifically, the feeding stragegy and the habitat occupied by the predator . In addition, the dispersal rates of the prey population is important. Empirical work needs to be better associated with theoretical knowledge to really understand the role of habitat loss in predator-prey systems. 

        
In general, omnivores (or generalists) should be less vulnerable to prey habitat loss compared to specialist predators. Prey respond to habitat loss in many different ways depending on the predator in the system. Dispersal abilities of both prey and predator is also important in examining the effect of habitat fragmentation. A number of issues should be addressed by experimental setups when assessing effect of habitat fragmentation: predator feeding strategy, habitat used by the predator, habitat loss or fragmentation, spatial scale, comparing systems with predators to those without, and dispersal ability of prey and predators. },

Even with a high level of interspersion between conservation, tourism and fishing management zones, major differences in densities of economically important species were evident between zone types prior to enforcement of fishing restrictions. Densities of the most valuable fishery resource, sea cucumbers, were three times higher in zones that remained open to fishing compared to ‘no-take' conservation zones, and densities of sharks were five times higher in tourism zones than fishing or conservation zones. These results highlight bias in the socio-political processes that can accompany selection of marine protected areas, where fishers attempt to minimize perceived impacts on their livelihood by locating large protected zones in resource-poor areas, and tourism operators and sport divers argue for protection of areas containing atypically-interesting features. Bias in the location of fully protected zones can seriously confound ‘control-impact' field investigations when data prior to prohibitions on fishing are lacking, including meta-analyses, which are dominated by such potentially systematically biased studies.},

Science
Conflicting evidence has emerged for the identity of avian wing digits between paleotological and embryological studies. This paper tried to address this question by using transcriptomic data from 40 chicken forelimb and hindlimb digits. This seems like a lot of RNA was needed. Would this be useful for other, potentially rare, species? They found that the first wing digit and the first foot digit have transcriptomes that are highly correlated. This is interesting because the first wing digit is known to develop from embryological position 2. In addition, they found that hindlimb an forelimb digits were very differentiated. This is the first study to use transcriptomic data to examine digit homologies. 

        
Technology
40 inviduals embyonic chicken digits were used to perform mRNA sequencing on an Illumina machine. Over 14000 genes were available for analysis. mRNA-seq data was then analyzing to look for correlation between different digits and to examine differential gene expression. Is correlation all you can really obtain from this type of analysis? Reads obtained from mRNA-seq were assembled to a known chicken genome. Software was used to examine the different gene expression levels in the different digits. They were able to identify the specific genes that were more highly expressed in different digits, providing clues to their origin. There methods really seem like more of a way to an end, with so much focus on the science rather than the technique itself. I find this much more interesting than the alternative. },

This record shows features that are closely linked with the Pacific North America pattern for the period of instrumental data availability. Our record extends back in time to cover the period from the closing stages of the Little Ice Age to the warmest decade in the past millennium7. We find a positive, accelerating trend in snow accumulation after the middle of the nineteenth century. This trend is paralleled by a warming over northwestern North America which has been associated with secular changes in both the Pacific North America pattern and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

abstract = {Organisms have been important agents of selection throughout the history of life. The processes and outcomes of this selection are the subject of this review. Among these, escalation is the most widespread. The primary selective agents are powerful competitors and consumers, which together push many populations toward higher performance in acquiring and defending resources while relegating less competitive species to physiologically marginal settings, where escalation also ensues. The extent to which performance standards rise depends on enabling factors, which control availability of and access to resources. By establishing positive feedbacks between species and enabling factors, effective competitors regulate and enhance resource supply. The pace of escalation toward greater power and reach is dictated by geological factors as well as by growing interdependencies between species and their resources. Evolutionary events on land related to the production of oxygen may have been instrumental in triggering the major episodes of escalation.},

Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompa- nied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators.

Yet not only does this question remain unresolved, it has largely fallen into disregard. With the rapid decrease in sequencing costs, we argue that it is time to revive it.},
annote = {Beginning in the 1960{\&}{\#}039;s, researchers have been interested in the genetic diversity differences among species. These original studies looked at allozumes to estimate genetic diversity of hundreds of species. These data are limited because allozymes don{\&}{\#}039;t show all genetic changes. These limitations led to a lack of interest in the question of genetic diversity in different species. With new sequencing technologies, it should be much easier to address this question. 

        
The authors compiled a small dataset (167 species) of diversity levels in euakrayotes. Generally, they found that species with larger populaiton sizes, do have more neutral genetic diversity. They also correlate diversity with a number of ecological and life-history traits. They found that the most diverse phyla were aquatic organisms. Species with large ranges, are usually most diverse. 

        
Although diversity levels increased for species that had larger population sizes, they did not increase near as much as theory would predict. In order to really address this question, mutation rates for various species are also needed. It is possible that mutation rates are inversly related to effective population size. 

        
Information on genetic diversity is important in an applied context. The small range of genetic diversity in nature may hint at some lower bound neccesary for species to persist (population may be too inbred at some point). Further too much diversity, may lead to reproductive incompatibilies. It is unclear how this latter idea would affect conservation science. 

        
Questions:
1. Would more recently evolved species have less diversity?

        
2. Genetic diversity allows for evolution to act, but how much does ecology then affect the amount of genetic diversity?

abstract = {Coral reefs are experiencing devastating mortality due, in part, to emerging disease. Despite this growing problem, the long-term consequences of infectious disease in marine ecosystems remain poorly understood, and the application of epidemiological models to marine disease systems represents a research priority for managing resources in the world's oceans. Metapopulation models may provide a framework for modelling coral population dynamics at the regional scale, and we use this approach to investigate the effects of infectious disease. The model presented here incorporates a susceptible-infected or 'S-I' disease into a system of patchily distributed, dynamic coral hosts, and highlights some basic differences that set many marine disease systems apart from their terrestrial counterparts. The model predicts several possible long-term outcomes of disease introduction, and suggests that the consequences of disease may vary considerably among different pathogens and regions. Due to the long time-scales for coral dynamics, epizootics are expected to be prolonged with recovery slow at the regional scale. Our model results show how infectious disease can substantially alter host metapopulation dynamics, with some non-linear relationships which are likely to affect the response of these systems to management and environmental change. For example, higher rates of coral colonization can have variable consequences for host population occupancy (i.e. coral cover) when infectious disease is considered, and chronic diseases with long-lived pathogens pose the highest risks for regional coral extinction. Synthesis and applications. We present a tractable epidemiological model within a metapopulation framework and compare the model output with empirical data for a white plague type II (WPII) outbreak among coral of the upper Florida Keys. We conclude that this model fits well with the spatial and temporal patterns of WPII over a decade. Despite terrestrial2013marine differences, many patterns derived from our model are consistent with epidemiological principles. Thus, the careful application of these principles within the context of marine management may be a promising research frontier. Although we focus on coral disease, the methods and results may apply to other marine metapopulations.},

abstract = {Some of the clearest examples of the ramifying effects of resource pulses exist in deciduous forests dominated by mast-producing trees, such as oaks, beech, and hornbeam. Seed production in these forests represents only the first of several pulsed events. Secondary pulses emerge as mast-consuming small rodents numerically respond to seed production and tertiary pulses emerge as generalist predators numerically respond to rodents. Raptors may also respond behaviorally (i.e., diet shifts) to subsequent crashes in small rodents following the crash phase in seed production. In oak-dominated forest in the Hudson Valley, New York, these various pulse and crash phases act synergistically, although not simultaneously, to influence thrush population dynamics through predation on nests, juveniles, and adults. As a consequence, factors limiting population growth rate and their age-specific action vary as a function of past acorn production. We highlight these interactions based on our eight-year study of thrush demography, acorn production, and small mammal abundance coupled with information on regional adult thrush population trends from the Breeding Bird Survey. We use these data sets to demonstrate the sequence of primary to tertiary pulses and how they influence breeding thrush populations. To extend our discussion beyond masting phenomena in the eastern United States, we briefly review the literature of alternative avian prey within pulsed systems to show (1) numerical and behavioral responses by generalist predators are ubiquitous in pulsed systems, and this contributes to (2) variability in reproduction and survivorship of avian prey linked to the underlying dynamics of the pulse. We conclude by exploring the broad consequences of cascading resource pulses for alternative prey based upon the indirect interaction of apparent competition among shared prey and the nature of temporal variability on populations.},

Plants and animals show profound annual cycles in physiology, health, mor- phology, behaviour and demography in response to environmental cues.

Human populations show robust annual rhythms in health and well-being, and the birth month can have lasting effects that persist throughout life.This reviewemphasizestheneed fora betterunderstand- ing of seasonal biology against the backdrop of its rapidly progressing disruption through climate change, human lifestyles and other anthropogenic impact. Climate change is modifying annual rhythms to which numerous organisms have adapted, with potential consequences for industries relating to health, ecosystems and food security. Disconcertingly, human lifestyles under artificial conditions of eternal summer provide the most extreme example for disconnect from natural seasons, making humans vulnerable to increased morbidity and mortality. In this review, we intro- duce scenarios of seasonal disruption, highlight key aspects of seasonal biology and summarize frombiomedical, anthro- pological, veterinary, agricultural and environmental perspectives the recent evidence for seasonal desynchroniza- tion between environmental factors and internal rhythms.

Baskett et al (2007) review theoretical and empirical work to explain the effects of including different types of species interactions in thinking about marine reserves. They find a number of general conclusions. Larger and less fragmented reserves tend to do better when accounting for species interactions (competition, predation, mutualisms). After a marine reserve is implemented there may be inherit time delays and trophic cascades are possible if a previously harvested predator is now better protected. Generally, the most vulnerable species will be top predators, long-distance dispersers, and poor colonizers. Interaction types, dispersal, harvest regimes outside the reserve, and ontogenetic shifts are all important considerations when implementing marine reserves. 


In addition, they found that the dynamics outside the marine reserve may be very important.},

abstract = {Abstract. Animal movement and behavior may respond to habitat modification or fragmentation in non trivial ways, thereby strongly conditioning the fate of populations. This study aims to understand movement patterns of non-dispersal animals in both natural and altered landscapes, using the endangered terrestrial tortoise Testudo graeca as example. We used individual-based simulation models representing competing hypotheses on tortoise movement. Model parameterization and selection was based on radiotracking data and an inverse approach that is able to deal with observation uncertainty, individual variability, and process stochasticity. We find that land use intensification had a strong impact on the movement and behavior of non-dispersing individuals of T. graeca. In natural landscapes, males and females showed a similar movement and behavior profile with a strong home behavior component, and little individual variability. However, in altered landscapes, movement and behavior greatly varied among individuals, particularly in females, and males and females showed different movement patterns. Females showed a wide range of movement patterns, from strong home behavior to an unbounded movement. Our study shows that population or movement models that assume single behavioral states for animals inhabiting different landscape structures can be strongly misleading and, furthermore, that the impact of landscape modification on movement and behavioral patterns can be strongly sex-biased. Flexible, individual-based movement models coupled with inverse parameterization and model selection approaches proved useful in understanding the mechanisms controlling animal movement patterns.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One major challenge in understanding how biodiversity is organized is finding out whether communities of competing species are shaped exclusively by species-level differences in ecological traits (niche theory), exclusively by random processes (neutral theory of biodiversity), or by both processes simultaneously. Communities of species competing for a pulsed resource are a suitable system for testing these theories: due to marked fluctuations in resource availability, the theories yield very different predictions about the timing of resource use and the synchronization of the population dynamics between the competing species. Accordingly, we explored mechanisms that might promote the local coexistence of phytophagous insects (four sister species of the genus Curculio) competing for oak acorns, a pulsed resource. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the time partitioning of the exploitation of oak acorns by the four weevil species in two independent communities, and we assessed the level of synchronization in their population dynamics. In accordance with the niche theory, overall these species exhibited marked time partitioning of resource use, both within a given year and between different years owing to different dormancy strategies between species, as well as distinct demographic patterns. Two of the four weevil species, however, consistently exploited the resource during the same period of the year, exhibited a similar dormancy pattern, and did not show any significant difference in their population dynamics. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The marked time partitioning of the resource use appears as a keystone of the coexistence of these competing insect species, except for two of them which are demographically nearly equivalent. Communities of consumers of pulsed resources thus seem to offer a promising avenue for developing a unifying theory of biodiversity in fluctuating environments which might predict the co-occurrence, within the same community, of species that are ecologically either very similar, or very different.},

The results indicate that these trends are not driven by: reserves being placed in more productive areas or displacement of fishing effort. Tropical vs temperate reserves do not differe in their benefits or success. Small reserves can still produce biological responses. Not all species increase in response to rserves because of differences in life history traits. The context of a marine reserve also plays a large effect in determining the reserve's success. 


Many parts of the world have reserves in place but with inadequate data to judge the effect of implementation or enforcement efforts. These parks may simply be paper parks. "If you do not invest time and money into enforcement and assessement, the park looks like a positive thing."- ME.

abstract = {Coastal upwelling regimes associated with eastern boundary currents are the most biologically productive ecosystems in the ocean. As a result, they play a disproportionately important role in the microbially mediated cycling of marine nutrients. These systems are characterized by strong natural variations in carbon dioxide concentrations, pH, nutrient levels and sea surface temperatures on both seasonal and interannual timescales. Despite this natural variability, changes resulting from human activities are starting to emerge. Carbon dioxide derived from fossil fuel combustion is adding to the acidity of upwelled low-pH waters. Low-oxygen waters associated with coastal upwelling systems are growing in their extent and intensity as a result of a rise in upper ocean temperatures and productivity. And nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean continue to grow. Coastal upwelling systems may prove more resilient to changes resulting from human activities than other ocean ecosystems because of their ability to function under extremely variable conditions. Nevertheless, shifts in primary production, fish yields, nitrogen gain and loss, and the flux of climate-relevant gases could result from the perturbation of these highly productive and dynamic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Site fidelity and migratory movements of vertebrate animals occur at many spatial and temporal scales. Larger migratory movements tend to occur in species that live in seasonal environments in which food supplies vary markedly, while species found in thermally stable environments are more site-attached. In the marine environment, seasonal migrations are often associated with predictable temporary aggre- gations that have largely been targeted for exploitation. We employed passive acoustic telemetry to investigate inter- and intraseasonal site fidelity of zebra sharks to an aggregation site in southeast Queensland, Australia, close to the southern latitudinal extent of this species' range. We tracked 10 zebra sharks over two aggregation seasons (21 months). We applied a generalized linear mixed-effects model to investigate the presence/absence of these zebra sharks with respect to several environmental vari- ables. We found that different environmental factors were associated with site fidelity of zebra sharks at different temporal levels and that these may be indicative of the mechanisms driving the movements. Seasonal patterns may be driven by endogenous systems, and cues such as photoperiod and water temperature are likely to be important. Intraseasonal patterns are more likely to be indicative of direct behavioural responses to changes in environmental conditions such as increased wave heights, as well as foraging bouts away from a core refuge. Understanding the relative contributions of these environmental parameters, as well as biological factors, will be important for making predictions of site fidelity and movements of migratory marine vertebrates under differing future scenarios such as increases in sea temperature.},

abstract = {Climate change has differentially affected the timing of seasonal events for interacting trophic levels, and this has often led to increased selection on seasonal timing. Yet, the environmental variables driving this selection have rarely been identified, limiting our ability to predict future ecological impacts of climate change. Using a dataset spanning 31 years from a natural population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), we show that directional selection on timing of reproduction intensified in the first two decades (1980-2000) but weakened during the last decade (2001-2010). Against expectation, this pattern could not be explained by the temporal variation in the phenological mismatch with food abundance. We therefore explored an alternative hypothesis that selection on timing was affected by conditions individuals experience when arriving in spring at the breeding grounds: arriving early in cold conditions may reduce survival. First, we show that in female recruits, spring arrival date in the first breeding year correlates positively with hatch date; hence, early-hatched individuals experience colder conditions at arrival than late-hatched individuals. Second, we show that when temperatures at arrival in the recruitment year were high, early-hatched young had a higher recruitment probability than when temperatures were low. We interpret this as a potential cost of arriving early in colder years, and climate warming may have reduced this cost. We thus show that higher temperatures in the arrival year of recruits were associated with stronger selection for early reproduction in the years these birds were born. As arrival temperatures in the beginning of the study increased, but recently declined again, directional selection on timing of reproduction showed a nonlinear change. We demonstrate that environmental conditions with a lag of up to two years can alter selection on phenological traits in natural populations, something that has important implications for our understanding of how climate can alter patterns of selection in natural populations.},

On the mechanistic derivation of various discrete-time population models, Bull. Math. Biol. 69, 329-346]. We assume that the total number of juveniles one adult individual can produce is a finite constant, and we study how this number should be distributed during the season, when certain interaction and mortality processes are also included in the model. If aggressive interactions between the juveniles are not included in the model, evolution is simply optimizing, and the optimal reproductive strategy is always a single Dirac ??-peak within the season. If aggressive interactions between the juveniles are included, an evolutionarily stable strategy can consist of not only one or two ??-peaks, but also of continuous reproduction during the season.

abstract = {High spawning flows from Hugh Keenleyside Dam (HKD) on the Columbia River results in dewatering of eggs in mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) populations, but the ultimate effect on adult abundance depends on the shape of the egg-to-adult recruitment curve. Our decision analysis assessed the benefits of alternative flow experiments while accounting for uncertainties in this relationship and in flows in the Columbia and Kootenay rivers. The value of experimenting depended on the true recruitment relationship, how we quantified experimental benefits, and experimental design. With current uncertainty, the optimal HKD spawning flow (out of 11 alternative flows) was 1699.2 m3{\textperiodcentered}s–1. Spawning flows below 1699.2 m3{\textperiodcentered}s–1 did not improve egg survival because lower flows rendered high- quality spawning habitat unavailable and increased scour mortality. Two experimental designs, both with higher preci- sion monitoring, had a high probability of detecting the true recruitment curve at reasonable cost. Information from these experiments suggested an optimal spawning flow of 1699.2 m3{\textperiodcentered}s–1 if adult abundance were sensitive to egg mor- tality or 1982.4 m3{\textperiodcentered}s–1 if the population were insensitive.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to be a major cause of species extinctions in the next 100 years. Butwhatwill actually cause these extinctions? For example, will it be limited physiological tolerance to high temperatures, changing biotic interactions or other factors? Here, we systematically review the proximate causes of climate-change related extinctions and their empirical support. We find 136 case studies of climatic impacts that are potentially rel- evant to this topic. However, only seven identified proximate causes of demonstrated local extinctions due to anthropogenic climate change. Among these seven studies, the proximate causes vary widely. Surprisingly, none showa straightforward relationship between local extinction and limited toler- ances to high temperature. Instead,many studies implicate species interactions as an important proximate cause, especially decreases in food availability.We find very similar patterns in studies showing decreases in abundance associ- ated with climate change, and in those studies showing impacts of climatic oscillations. Collectively, these results highlight our disturbingly limited knowledge of this crucial issue but also support the idea that changing species interactions are an important cause of documented population declines and extinctions related to climate change. Finally, we briefly outline general research strategies for identifying these proximate causes in future studies. 1.},

Science
All sequencing of genomes can provide some information on the diversity of species, more detailed studies on gene expression are also needed. Diversity of gene expression is probably an important component of phenotypic diversity and evolution. This study looked at total and allele-specific expression in two Drosophila species and their hybrids. They showed an impressive 78{\%} of expressed genes had differing levels of expression between species. They also found evidence that seems to reject the idea that increases or decreases in gene expression are equally likely (a neutral model). Cis- and trans-regulatory divergence did differ between species, 51{\%} and 66{\%} respectively. This is important as cis-regulatory sequences deal with allele-specific effects and trans-regulatory factors affect both alleles. Different levels of cis- and trans- changes may be a reflection upon the evolutionary history of D. sechellia. This is an island species with low genetic variation and a smaller population than the other species. Thus natural selection in this species should be less effective. They specifically found that regulatory diveragence may have led to the evolution of different feeding behaviors in the two Drosophila species. I{\&}{\#}039;m interested in how gene expression may change depending on environmental conditions or a setup in a lab. Depending on the trait I imagine a gene could be up- or down-regulated. 

        

        
Technology
Gene expression of two species of Drosophila, and their hybrid offspring, were examined by paired-end sequencing (mRNA-seq). About 4.5 micrograms of RNA was needed from each species. Between 26 million and 42 million reads were obtained for the three groups. Any ambgigious reads were not used when mapping the sequencing to a reference genome. They do point out that for their analyses a reference genome isn{\&}{\#}039;t actually needed, though it does make the analysis much simpler. An error rate of only 0.8{\%} was find for all species combined. Gene expression levels were determined by comparing mRNA-seq data to that using pyrosequencing. They conducted pyrosequencing for 15 genes and determined the relative expression between the two species. },

abstract = {Across the United States there is increasing concern about the dwindling scientific workforce and the lack of students prepared for careers in the sciences. To build future leadership in this arena, we must employ innovative approaches that generate young peoples' interest and develop their capabilities so that an increased number will pursue and be prepared for careers in scientific fields. Marine ecology is an ideal platform to engage young people in the sciences, develop their skills across multiple disciplines, and prepare them to face the complex challenges that lie ahead. In response, Ocean Discovery Institute, a non-profit organization, has developed Ocean Leaders, a model program to empower young people to become tomorrow's scientific leaders. Using evaluation data that span the 5years of the program, we asked how this model can affect participants' interest and performance in science and how it can contribute directly to the field of marine ecology. Content assessments, surveys, interviews, and tracking data reveal that 73{\%} of Ocean Leader students during this period have declared majors in science and conservation fields, scored higher on standardized science tests relative to their peers, and contributed to ecological research through 10 publications and more than 30 scientific presentations. Using a framework analogous to adaptive management strategies, key components of the program (including in-depth interactions with scientists and rigorous college readiness coursework) have been identified, resulting in an increased number of students who are interested in and ready to pursue science careers. Critical to this model is the partnership between scientists and a non-profit organization. Although this model may not easily be replicated in its entirety, aspects of this collaboration and the strategies employed can help to simultaneously advance the field of marine ecology and scientific leadership and understanding. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {Winter is a key driver of individual performance, community composition, and ecological interactions in terrestrial habitats. Although climate change research tends to focus on performance in the growing season, climate change is also modifying winter conditions rapidly. Changes to winter temperatures, the variability of winter conditions, and winter snow cover can interact to induce cold injury, alter energy and water balance, advance or retard phenology, and modify community interactions. Species vary in their susceptibility to these winter drivers, hampering efforts to predict biological responses to climate change. Existing frameworks for predicting the impacts of climate change do not incorporate the complexity of organismal responses to winter. Here, we synthesise organismal responses to winter climate change, and use this synthesis to build a framework to predict exposure and sensitivity to negative impacts. This framework can be used to estimate the vulnerability of species to winter climate change. We describe the importance of relationships between winter conditions and performance during the growing season in determining fitness, and demonstrate how summer and winter processes are linked. Incorporating winter into current models will require concerted effort from theoreticians and empiricists, and the expansion of current growing-season studies to incorporate winter.},

The factors affecting whether abundance will increase within a reserve are well characterized; however, those results are based on long-term equilibria of population models. Here we use age-structured models of a generic fish population to analyze the short-term transient response. We show that it may take decades for a fished population to reach postreserve equilibrium. In the meantime, short-term transient dynamics dominate. During the transient phase, population abundance could either remain unchanged, decrease, or exhibit single-generation oscillations, regardless of the eventual long-term result. Such transient dynamics are longer and more oscillatory for populations with heavier fishing, older ages at maturity, lower natural mortality rates, and lower larval connectivity. We provide metrics based on demographic data to describe the important characteristics of these postreserve transient dynamics.},

abstract = {Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models. Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals (demographic stochasticity), variation in population-level birth and death rates among times or locations (environmental stochasticity), the sex of individuals and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population (demographic heterogeneity). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.},

Melbourne and Hastings (2008) investigate the role of these different types of stochastities by constructing models with different combinations of said types in Ricker models.

{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}


Overall, I really enjoyed reading Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World. Although long, at 450 pages, I read through it extremely quickly. I couldn't believe how well read he must have been. He cited everything from ancient Greek scholars to magazines and from political leaders to famous scientists. At some points his quoting of other sources did go on for pages and pages—probably unnecessarily. A few of the chapters certainly seem to meander and they felt like they did not have a clear topic. This was particularly true in the beginning of the book when Sagan discusses many examples of pseudoscience like UFO, government coverups, witchcraft, and alternative medicines. Consequently, I enjoyed the last 2/3 of the book much more. Here Sagan talked more about skepticism in general and the need for a strong education system. The first chapter of this type was the Balony Detection Kit—which reminded me a lot of Nagy's class of course. IN this chapter, Sagan lays out why a Balony Detection Kit is important not just in science, but also in politics, business, and everyday life. Sagan runs through a list of all the important tools in this Balony Detection Kit. I can see why Nagy referenced it so much in his class. Sagan feels very strongly about the need to educate not just future scientists but all citizens. He felt the most effective way to do this was through television.  


Chapter 1: 
lat scientifically literate president may have been Thomas Jefferson 


Chapter 2: Science and Hope 
Face in the moon, canals on Mars, photos from Apollo missions
pg 26: "We've arranged a global civilization in which most critical elements—transportation, communications, and all other industries; agriculture, medicine, education, entertainment, protecting the environment; and even the key democratic instrutionof voting—profoudly depend on science and technology"
pg 27: “Science is far from a perfect instrument of knowledge. It's just the best we have."
pg 27: “One of the reasons for its success is that science has built-in, error-correcting machinery at its very heart"
pg 37: 4 reasons to convery science to every citizen:
science can be a golden road out of poverty for emerging nations and people. The converse is also true
science provides a early warning system into a changing world
science teaches us about the deepest issues in the world
values of science and values of democracy are very similar




Chapter 4: Aliens 
-when he learned about process of science, how science actually works, while he was in college (pg 67) 
-Need more skepticism, especially in cases which seem extradinaroy or if we really want to believe they are true 
-pg 77: for most people the tools of skepticism are never taught or they are out of reach 


Chapter 5-11 
Sagan discussed a number of issues related to UFO, abductions, government coverups, and the importance of being skeptical. he also discusses ghosts, hallucinations, how therapy can make you believe things that aren't true—providing you with false visions of the past, how ideas have to be testable 


Chapter 12: The Fine Art of Balony Detection 
Sagan begins this chapter by discussing mediums and the stories we tell our kids to make them feel good (e.g. Santa)
“A sucker is born every minute” - P.T. Barnum
pg 210 Tools of the Baloney Detection Kit
independent confirmation of facts
debate on a topic
reject argument from authortiy
examine multiple hypotheses
don't get to attached to one hypothesis
quantify
if there is a chain argunement all links must work
occam's razor
always ask whether a hypothesis can be falsifiable
Need carefully designed and controlled experiments
Kit also includes things we must not do:
ad hominem- attacking the arguer and not the argument
argument from authority
argument from adverse consequences
appeal to ignorance - an idea not proved false but then be true
special pleading
begging the question
observational selection - counting the hits and forgetting the misses
statistics of small numbers
misunderstanding the nature of statistics - half of people are below average for instance is not alarming
inconsistency 
non sequitor - Latin for “it doesn't follow” 
post hoc “it happened after, so it was caused by"
meaningless question 
excluded middle or false dichtonmy- considering only two extremes
short term vs long term - we can't afford to spend money on space (long term) if we have a budget crisis (short term)
slippery slope - if we allow any abortion there is nothing preventing killing of infants
correlation and causation
straw man - caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack (shrimp on trendmills is crazy)
suprressed evidence or half-truths
weasel words - no boots on ground just "military advisors"
pg 217 tobacco industry history of companies suppressing evidence


CHapter 13: 
discusses James Randi and debunking pseudoscience


Chapter 14 Antiscience 
science is also facing attack not from just pseudoscience but from antiscience
Some see science as too subjective, like history
Scientists recongnize they make mistakes, they learn from them, and move on because of error-correcting machinery and the ability to do experiments
pg 256: Sagan explains a few times in his career where he was wrong: atmospheric pressure of Venus, clouds made of water on Venus, plate tectonics on Mars, and so forth
 It is often difficult to judge people in the past without placing them in correct context (e.g. Washington owned slave)
Sagan feels Thomas Paine is a bit of an exceptional in that he was far ahead of his time
Goes on to discuss situations where science or information in general has ben suppressed (e.g. Soviet Union)


Chapter 16: When scientists know sin 
In this chapter Sagan discusses how science can be misused—like the atomic and thermonuclear bombs. He discussed Oppenheimer and Edward Teller's conflicts during the Manahtten project. It was interesting to hear how badly Teller wanted a thermonuclear bomb—to a disturbing level. Teller was also a big proponent of the Star Wars project during the Reagan administration


Chapter 17: the marriage of skepticism and wonder 
pg 300: Sagan discusses that in the skeptic movement it is often a us versus them type of attitude. That skeptics are right of course. He argues this is not constructive. We have to show compassion to these individuals. 


Chapter 18: The wind makes dust 
He begins the chapter by asking, “ Why should so many people find science hard to learn and hard to teach?” - some have suggested it is hard b/c it is new. Science is not something that was helpful evolutionarily 
Scientists always build on the work of others
Sagan believes “A proclivity for science in embedded deeply within us, in all times, places and cultures. It has been the means of our survival. It is our birthright. When, through indifference, inattention, incompetence, or fear of skepticism, we discourage children from science, we are disenfranchising them, taking from them the tools needed to manage their future"


Chapter 19: No such thing as a dumb question 
“In a world in transition, students and teachers both need to teach themselves one essential skill—learning how to learn"
Felt children were natural-born scientists — somehow this changes by high school in which students no longer ask questions as they don't want to be embarrased
Feels adults often put down children's curiosity but not responding to their questions
“Bright, curious children are a national and world resource. They need to be cared for, cherished and encourage. But mere envoraement isn't enough. We must also give them the essential tools to think with."
Goes on to discuss how the US has fallen behind much of the world
Feels we do not spend enough on education and that students do not spend enough time in class or on homework - apparently research now doesn't really support this idea. Maybe it depends on which subjects you are interested in
Also discussed how minority students are still behind
Sagan believes at the university level we need imaginative, inspiring curricula dn textbooks from leading faculty. Feels scientists should spend more time engaging with public though textbooks, lectures, newspapers, magazines, and TV appearances, also feels all university students should have to take a class in skeptical thinking
Argues scientists have to speak to general public more

abstract = {Aspects of ecology-based environmentalism may run counter to how nature works; it is important to get the science right. The Janus Enigma Hypothesis is formulated as a flow???storage network approach to holistic ecological understanding. It proceeds from primary energy???matter consumption toward maximization of throughflow. When transferred material is energy, the goal function is maximum power (energy flow). The Janus Hypothesis has the following line of development: 1. The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics requires that the environments of aggrading (anti-entropic) processes become themselves degraded. To restrict such degradation is to limit life's processes.2. A maximum power conjecture holds that aggrading systems self-organize to maximize power generating work. Maximal resource use, work production, and environmental degradation necessarily follow. This applies also to material flow in generalized energy???matter (throughflow) processing.3. In maximizing power (throughflow), biota perform work to maximize their fitness (Type I, biological), but at the expense of degraded environments. Zero-sumness of conservative, consumptive transfers produces a proximate life???environment relationship that is win???lose.4. But covert mechanisms also operate such that maximizing throughflow also maximizes a system-wide, nonzero-sum, network property???dominant indirect effects.5. These maximize another property of network organization, network synergism. This transforms proximate, tangible, zero-sum, agonistic, (+, ???) transactions into ultimate, intangible, nonzero-sum, mainly positive (+, +) and synergistic relations. The proximate transactions lead by network processes to ultimate nonzero-sum benefits??{\textgreater}??costs, which is network synergism.6. By the indirect line from maximum power (throughflow) to network synergism, biotic work maximizes both biological and ecological fitness (Type II), and the life???environment relationship becomes win???win. This cannot be seen from pure empiricism because it plays out diffusely as limit processes in networks that are virtual.Three lines of evidence are presented in support of the Janus Hypothesis: (1) ???Building a biosphere??? by progressively adding nodes and links in simple compartment models shows throughflow and network synergism to be positively correlated. (2) Decomposing the utility measure of network synergism in these models into its constituents shows them to be largely made up of throughflows; maximum network synergism likely follows from the maximization of throughflow. (3) Comparing total system throughflow with network synergism in 31 food webs described for Ukrainian pasturelands shows the two measures to be positively correlated in this large empirical database. The Janus Hypothesis has a built-in paradox. Because the positive benefits derived from the nonzero-sum maximum throughflow???????network synergism???????Fitness-II line exceed the negative costs generated by the zero-sum maximum throughflow???????Fitness-I line, applied programs designed to reduce environmental degradation will reduce not only Fitness-I, but also Fitness-II by foregoing the implicit benefits of network synergism that inherently exceed the explicit costs of maximizing throughflow. This is the Janus Enigma. It means that well-meaning but misguided environmental programs may actually, in fact must, induce a lose???lose relationship between life and environment. If the Janus Hypothesis proves scientifically valid, environmentalism must resolve and manage the apparent conflict, and ecology as its parent science must expand its dimensions and become a complex systems science competent in understanding and methodology to meet the challenges of complex, intractable, non-obvious holism in nature's living networks.},

abstract = {In highly seasonal environments, offspring production by vertebrates is timed to coincide with the annual peak of resource availability. For herbivores, this resource peak is represented by the annual onset and progression of the plant growth season. As plant phenology advances in response to climatic warming, there is potential for development of a mismatch between the peak of resource demands by reproducing herbivores and the peak of resource availability. For migratory herbivores, such as caribou, development of a trophic mismatch is particularly likely because the timing of their seasonal migration to summer ranges, where calves are born, is cued by changes in day length, while onset of the plant-growing season on the same ranges is cued by local temperatures. Using data collected since 1993 on timing of calving by caribou and timing of plant growth in West Greenland, we document the consequences for reproductive success of a developing trophic mismatch between caribou and their forage plants. As mean spring temperatures at our study site have risen by more than 4 degrees C, caribou have not kept pace with advancement of the plant-growing season on their calving range. As a consequence, offspring mortality has risen and offspring production has dropped fourfold.},

abstract = {1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently.
2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems,where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible,`pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator--prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as `replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as `treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise.
4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to meso- predator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator--prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, con- servation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change.},

abstract = {In many fisheries, some component of the catch is usually released. Quantifying the effects of capture and release on fish survival is critical for determining which practices are sus- tainable, particularly for threatened species. Using a standardized fishing technique, we studied sublethal (blood physiology and reflex impairment assessment) and lethal (post-release mortality with satellite tags) outcomes of fishing stress on 5 species of coastal sharks (great hammerhead, bull, blacktip, lemon, and tiger). Species-specific differences were detected in whole blood lactate, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and pH values, with lactate emerging as the sole parameter to be significantly affected by increasing hooking duration and shark size. Species-spe- cific differences in reflex impairment were also found; however, we did not detect any significant relationships between reflex impairment and hooking duration. Taken together, we ranked each species according to degree of stress response, from most to least disturbed, as follows: hammer- head shark {\textgreater} blacktip shark {\textgreater} bull shark {\textgreater} lemon shark {\textgreater} tiger shark. Satellite tagging data revealed that nearly 100{\%} of all tracked tiger sharks reported for at least 4 wk after release, which was significantly higher than bull (74.1{\%}) and great hammerhead (53.6{\%}) sharks. We discuss which mechanisms may lead to species-specific differences in sensitivity to fishing and suggest that observed variation in responses may be influenced by ecological and evolutionary phenom- ena. Moreover, our results show that certain species (i.e. hammerhead sharks in this study) are inherently vulnerable to capture stress and mortality resulting from fisheries interactions and should receive additional attention in future conservation strategies.},

@article{Ward-Paige2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasingly, underwater visual censuses (UVC) are used to assess fish populations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities ({\textgreater}100,000 individuals x km(-2)) and biomasses ({\textgreater}4 tonnes x ha(-1)) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.},

When citations did not mention rebuttals, 95{\%} accepted the thesis of the original article uncritically, and support remained high over time. On the rare occasions when rebuttals were cited, the citing papers on average had neutral views of the original article, and 8{\%} actually believed that the rebuttal agreed with the original article. Overall, only 5{\%} of all citations were critical of the original paper. Our results point to an urgent need to change current publishing models to ensure that rebuttals are prominently linked to original articles.},

A red squirrel population in the southwest Yukon, Canada, faced with increasing spring temperatures and food supply has advanced the timing of breeding by 18 days over the last 10 years (6 days per generation). Longitudinal analysis of females breeding in multiple years suggests that much of this change in parturition date can be explained by a plastic response to increased food abundance (3.7 days per generation). Significant changes in breeding values (0.8 days per generation), were in concordance with predictions from the breeder's equation (0.6 days per generation), and indicated that an evolutionary response to strong selection favouring earlier breeders also contributed to the observed advancement of this heritable trait. The timing of breeding in this population of squirrels, therefore, has advanced as a result of both phenotypic changes within generations, and genetic changes among generations in response to a rapidly changing environment.},

abstract = {Metapopulation dynamics of American pikas (Ochotona princeps) at Bodie, California, were investigated with a series of annual-biennial occupancy surveys from 1989-2010 and compared with earlier censuses in 1972 and 1977. The pika population at Bodie represents one of the best examples of a classic metapopulation system: the pikas live in spatially distinct habitat patches scattered across an open landscape, all local populations are small and have a significant risk of extinction (patch extinction), dispersal among patches appears to be distance-dependent, and the dynamics of local populations appear to be asynchronous. Observed occurrences of patch extinctions (114) and re-colonizations (109) varied greatly among the 18 census intervals. Multiple non-trivial patch extinctions and re-colonizations refute an earlier finding claiming the occupancy pattern of pikas at Bodie could be explained by an extinction-disk model. By 1991 the southern constellation of patches underwent a metapopulation collapse, apparently the result of stochasticity of metapopulation dynamics in a small network that amplified the tendency toward regional extinction. Because of recent concern that American pikas may be increasingly vulnerable to warm temperatures due to climate change, and because the Bodie pika population represents the longest study of the species in a low-elevation (warm) environment, the potential impact of temperature on metapopulation dynamics was examined. There were no meaningful relationships between number of patch extinctions or re-colonizations with mean monthly maximum temperature in June, July and August, or number of days greater than or equal to 25o C and greater than or equal to 28o C, in the same or prior year. Further, there has been no decline in percent patch occupancy in the northern constellation of patches since 1989. Thus, there is no evidence that warm temperatures have negatively affected pika persistence directly. Warm temperatures, however, could have impeded the dispersal of colonists moving from north to south, thus contributing to the failure of this region to become repopulated.},

In order to assess the adaptive value of observed changes, we study how annual plants with and without growth constraints should optimize their flowering time when productivity and season length changes. We consider growth constraints that depend on the plant's vegetative mass: self-shading, costs for nonphotosynthetic structural tissue and sibling competition. We derive the optimal flowering time from a dynamic energy allocation model using optimal control theory. We prove that an immediate switch (bang-bang control) from vegetative to reproductive growth is optimal with constrained growth and constant mortality. Increasing mean productivity, while keeping season length constant and growth unconstrained, delayed the optimal flowering time. When growth was constrained and productivity was relatively high, the optimal flowering time advanced instead. When the growth season was extended equally at both ends, the optimal flowering time was advanced under constrained growth and delayed under unconstrained growth. Our results suggests that growth constraints are key factors to consider when interpreting phenological flowering responses. It can help to explain phenological patterns along productivity gradients, and links empirical observations made on calendar scales with life-history theory.},

abstract = {The ideal free distribution (IFD) theory is one of the most influential theories in evolutionary ecology. It predicts how animals ought to distribute themselves within a heterogeneous habitat in order to maximize lifetime fitness. We test the population level consequence of the IFD theory using 40-year worth data on pike (Esox lucius) living in a natural lake divided into two basins. We do so by employing empirically derived density-dependent survival, dispersal and fecundity functions in the estimation of basin-specific density-dependent fitness surfaces. The intersection of the fitness surfaces for the two basins is used for deriving expected spatial distributions of pike. Comparing the derived expected spatial distributions with 50 years data of the actual spatial distribution demonstrated that pike is ideal free distributed within the lake. In general, there was a net migration from the less productive north basin to the more productive south basin. However, a pike density-manipulation experiment imposing shifting pike density gradients between the two basins managed to switch the net migration direction and hence clearly demonstrated that the Windermere pike choose their habitat in an ideal free manner. Demonstration of ideal free habitat selection on an operational field scale like this has never been undertaken before.},
annote = {The ideal free distribution hypothesis was proposed over 40 years ago, but empirical evidence has been lacking. Haugen et al (2006) used an amazing data set (over four decades) of pike populations in two basins of the same lake. The ideal free distribution says that pike should disperse between the two basins in order to maximize their individual fitness. They found that a fitness gradient did exist between the two basins and pika would increase/decrease their dispersal accordingly. Typically, the southern basin was more productive, but a density-reduction in the north lowered the population enough to change the fitness gradient and pike dispersed accordingly. This density-reduction experiment provided the clearest evidence for me the pike did in fact follow an ideal free distribution. 


I was surprised their population estimates did not include estimates of error, as the population size was estimated from fishery data. 
How do pike assess their environments?

Instead, an index of habitat quality and the connectivity of a patch were found to be the best predictors of pika extinction. 3. Similarly, patch connectivity only partly explained the recolonization of talus patches by pikas. Other patch characteristics, including aspect, amount of vegetation within the patch and an index of habitat quality based on survival probability of pikas also had a significant influence on recolonization. 4.

Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected, in a manner inconsistent with expectations, and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database, 81-83{\%} of all observations for distribution, phenology, community composition, abundance, demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change.

Here, we review recent studies investigating phenotypic shifts in exploited populations and strategies for minimizing fisheries-induced evolution.

Although resilience has been a highly influential concept, its interpretation has remained largely qualitative.

Such slowing down can be measured experimentally but may also be indirectly inferred from changes in natu- ral fluctuations and spatial patterns. A second group of methods aims to characterize the resilience of alternative states in probabilistic terms based on large numbers of observations as in long time series or satellite images. These generic approaches to measuring resilience complement the system- specific knowledge needed to infer the effects of environmental change on the resilience of complex systems.},

abstract = {SOCPROG is a set of programs which analyses data on animal associations. Data usually come from observations of the social behaviour of individually identifiable animals. Associations among animals, sampling periods, restrictions on the data and association indices can be defined very flexibly. SOCPROG can analyse data sets including 1,000 or more individuals. Association matrices are displayed using sociograms, principal coordinates analysis, multidimensional scaling and cluster analyses. Permutation tests, Mantel and related tests and matrix correlation methods examine hypotheses about preferred associations among individuals and classes of individual. Weighted network statistics are calculated and can be tested against null hypotheses. Temporal analyses include displays of lagged association rates (rates of reassocia- tion following an association). Models can be fitted to lagged association rates. Multiple association measures, including measures produced by other programs such as genetic or range use data, may be analysed using Mantel tests and principal components analysis. SOCPROG also performs mark-recapture population analyses and move- ment analyses. SOCPROG is written in the programming language MATLAB and may be downloaded free from the World Wide Web.},

We sought to clarify how selection, phenotypic plasticity, and demography are linked in the context of climate change. On the basis of theory and results of recent empirical studies of plants and animals, we believe the ecological and evolutionary issues relevant to population persistence as climate changes are the rate, type, magnitude, and spatial pattern of climate-induced abiotic and biotic change; generation time and life history of the organism; extent and type of phenotypic plasticity; amount and distribution of adaptive genetic variation across space and time; dispersal potential; and size and connectivity of subpopulations. An understanding of limits to plasticity and evolutionary potential across traits, populations, and species and feedbacks between adaptive and demographic responses is lacking. Integrated knowledge of coupled ecological and evolutionary mechanisms will increase understanding of the resilience and probabilities of persistence of populations and speciesResumen:G{\c{C}}{\'{e}}El cambio clim+{\'{i}}tico afecta a organismos individuales alterando su desarrollo, fisiolog+¡a, comportamiento y adaptabilidad y a las poblaciones alterando la composici+¦n gen+¬tica y fenot+¡pica, las tasas vitales y su din+{\'{i}}mica.

-CC can change peak height and location on adaptive landscape

-to track changes in environment, species can have adaptive evolution (changes in gene frequencies) and adaptive phenotypic plasticity

-pops in more variable environments experience fluctuating selection (Easterling et al 2000) - plasticity would be facored in this case

-need mechanistic models to predict future responses to climate change (Holt 1990)
--example of long term data on Great Tits in Netherlands - measured strength of directional selection and noticed earlier data of egg laying based on food resources

-discuss importance of selection on multiple correlated traits and how that alters dynamics
--point oout that under CC there should be strong selection for timinig of events, physiological toleraces, diet preferences, and disease reisistance
Bradshaw and Holzapfel (2008) argue timing of traits will be under strongest selection

Phenotypic plasticity
-squirrels in Yukon have responded to earlier cone production mostly through plasticity as opposed to genetic adaptation
-plasticity has limits though (DeWitt et al 1998)
-plasticity not well studied in wild populations
-reactions norms are functional relations that desribe how traits change as a result of plasticity when the environment changes
-reaction norm incepts and slopes can be heritable
-fluctuating conditions promotes evolution of plasticity (Svanback et al 2009)
-plasticity can of course be costly
-adaptive plasticity will reduce demographic effect of strong selection (Chevin et al 2010)


Summary:
This paper is a broad overview of how evolution, plasticity, and demography are inheritantly linked. Understanding the interactions between them is crucial for predicting and responding to species' responses to climate change. They stress that in a changing environment, species will always lag behind some phenotypic optimum. They also point out that climate change can alter these fitness landscapes in several ways including optimum locations or the elevation of the fitness surface. They discuss notion that species living in variable environments should probably have a higher propensity for phenotypic plasticity. They stres that when selection acts on several traits or if there are correlations among traits, the rate of evolition will be slower.},

abstract = {1. An outdoor cage experiment was conducted to test the theory that localized interactions facilitate coexistence of species breeding in ephemeral habitats. The same amount of larval resource (50 g of liver) but divided into one, two, four, eight or sixteen pieces was placed into each of fifteen cages once a week from June to September for 4 years. 2. The cage populations were initially mixtures of thirteen species but after 4 years only Lucilia illustris (Meig.), Sarcophaga scoparia Pand. and S.aratrix Pand. remained. Lucilia illustris, by far the most abundant species in the field, predominated in every cage. 3. Sarcophaga went extinct in most cages, but they survived in five cages in which the larval resource was much divided, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. 4. Lucilia silvarum (Meig.) emerged about a week later than L.illustris in early summer; this phenological difference gave rise to a competitive asymmetry between the two species. This difference appears to explain why L.silvarum went extinct in the cages in 3 years, and it may explain why L.silvarum has consistently been lesb abundant than L.illustris in the natural community. 5. Other differences in phenology, voltinism and rate of development in the flies are described, and such differences are suggested to facilitate regional coexistence of many species in seasonal environments.},

Five sharks visited Cocos Island, 627 km distant from Malpelo. One of the sharks that appeared at Cocos Island also visited the Galapagos Islands, 710 km from Cocos, a month later. There is connectivity of Sphyrna lewini between Malpelo, Cocos and the Galapagos Islands, but the frequency of movements between the islands appears to be relatively low ({\textless}7{\%} of the tagged sharks). The most common depth at which the sharks swam coincided with the thermocline (rs=0.72, p{\textless}0.01). The depth of the thermocline varied depending on the time of the year. Nocturnal detections of the sharks were more frequent during the cold season than during the warm season (W=60, p{\textless}0.01).

abstract = {The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmentation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

In the past 30 years, a substantial scientific literature on the subject has developed, international agreements have set targets for proportion of the sea to be protected, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on research and advocacy for MPA establishment. While the objectives of MPAs are diverse, few studies evaluate the success of MPAs against stated objectives. It is clear that well-enforced MPAs will protect enough fish from exploitation that within reserves abundance increases, fish live to be larger, and measures of diversity are higher. What is much more poorly understood is the impacts of reserve establishment on areas outside reserves. Theory suggests that when stocks are seriously overfished outside reserves, the yield and abundance outside the reserves may be increased by spillover from the reserve. When stocks are not overexploited, reserve establishment will likely decrease the total yield. The chapters in this volume explore a broad set of case studies of MPAs, their objectives and their outcomes.},

abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coverage-based rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages.},

In a eagle-pig-fox-skunk system, the introduction of pigs may have led to the extinction of the island fox. In turn, this led to a competitive release of skunks. 


The study combines the predation and competition Lotka-Volterra models. These models were parameterized from field studies, stable isotope diet analysis, and metabolic requirements of each species. When pigs are included in the model, there is enough food for golden eagles to colonize the island. This causes a decrease in foxes and a increase in skunks. Without pigs, eagles are not able to colonize the island.

To test this prediction, we artificially selected along all eight genetic eigenvectors of a set of eight quantitative traits in Drosophila serrata. After six generations of 50{\%} truncation selection, at least one replicate population of all treatments responded to selection, allowing us to reject a null genetic subspace as a cause of evolutionary constraint in this system. However, while all three replicate populations of the first five selection treatments displayed a significant response, the remaining three, characterized by low genetic variance in their selection indexes in the base population, displayed inconsistent responses to selection. The observation that only four of the nine replicate populations evolved in response to the direct selection applied to them in these low genetic variance treatments, led us to conclude that a nearly null subspace did limit evolution. Dimensions associated with low genetic variance are often found in multivariate analyses of standing genetic variance in morphological traits, suggesting that the nearly null genetic subspace may be a common mechanism of evolutionary constraint in nature.},

Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of $\alpha$ diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity.

abstract = {Seasonal polyphenisms are widespread in nature, yet the selective pressures responsible for their evolution remain poorly understood. Previous work has largely focussed either on the developmental regulation of seasonal polyphenisms or putative 'top-down' selective pressures such as predation that may have acted to drive phenotypic divergence. Much less is known about the influence of seasonal variation in resource availability or seasonal selection on optimal resource allocation. We studied seasonal variation in resource availability, uptake and allocation in Araschnia levana L., a butterfly species that exhibits a striking seasonal colour polyphenism consisting of predominantly orange 'spring form' adults and black-and-white 'summer form' adults. 'Spring form' individuals develop as larvae in the late summer, enter a pupal diapause in the fall and emerge in the spring, whereas 'summer form' individuals develop directly during the summer months. We find evidence for seasonal declines in host plant quality, and we identify similar reductions in resource uptake in late summer, 'spring form' larvae. Further, we report shifts in the body composition of diapausing 'spring form' pupae consistent with a physiological cost to overwintering. However, these differences do not translate into detectable differences in adult body composition. Instead, we find minor seasonal differences in adult body composition consistent with augmented flight capacity in 'summer form' adults. In comparison, we find much stronger signatures of sex-specific selection on patterns of resource uptake and allocation. Our results indicate that resource dynamics in A. levana are shaped by seasonal fluctuations in host plant nutrition, climatic conditions and intraspecific interactions.},

The Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant Class, and the most frequently recorded OTUs were members of the Rickettsiales (SAR 11) and Rhodobacteriales. This near-surface ocean bacterial community showed strong repeatable seasonal patterns, which were defined by winter peaks in diversity across all years. Environmental variables explained far more variation in seasonally predictable bacteria than did data on protists or metazoan biomass. Change in day length alone explains {\textgreater}65{\%} of the variance in community diversity. The results suggested that seasonal changes in environmental variables are more important than trophic interactions. Interestingly, microbial association network analysis showed that correlations in abundance were stronger within bacterial taxa rather than between bacteria and eukaryotes, or between bacteria and environmental variables.},

The Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD), one of the largest collections of population time series available, has been extensively used to study cross-taxa patterns in density dependence. A major difficulty with assessing density dependence from time series is that uncertainty in population abundance estimates can cause strong bias in both tests and estimates of strength. We analyse 627 data sets in the GPDD using Gompertz population models and account for uncertainty via the Kalman filter. Results suggest that at least 45{\%} of the time series display density dependence, but that it is weak and difficult to detect for a large fraction. When uncertainty is ignored, magnitude of and evidence for density dependence is strong, illustrating that uncertainty in abundance estimates qualitatively changes conclusions about density dependence drawn from the GPDD.},

Unfortunately, an often overlooked property of this potential connectivity is that it may change with time. In the marine realm, transient landscape features, such as mesoscale eddies and alongshore jets, produce potential connectivity that is highly variable in time. We assess the impact of this temporal variability by comparing simulations of nearshore metapopulation dynamics when potential connectivity is constant through time (i.e., when it is deterministic) and when it varies in time (i.e., when it is stochastic). We use mathematical analysis to reach general conclusions and realistic biophysical modeling to determine the actual magnitude of these changes for a specific system: nearshore marine species in the Southern California Bight. We find that in general the temporal variability of potential connectivity affects two important quantities: metapopulation growth rates when the species is rare and equilibrium abundances. Our biophysical models reveal that stochastic outcomes are almost always lower than their deterministic counterparts, sometimes by up to 40{\%}. This has implications for how we use spatial information, such as connectivity, to manage nearshore (and other) systems.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, much effort has been devoted towards quantifying and reducing bycatch in marine fisheries. Of late, there has been a particular focus on sharks given that bycatch is a frequently listed threat for sharks on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List. However, currently there are no quantitative reviews or syntheses that explore the issue of shark bycatch globally which is problematic given that such a synthesis could inform conservation actions and identify pressing research gaps. We performed a qualitative and quantitative survey of the peer- reviewed literature to characterize trends in shark bycatch research with a particular goal of identifying research needs and opportunities. Using a structured literature review we identified 103 search criteria, with the first one published in 1993. Early research efforts focused on documenting the scope of bycatch (i.e., determining that sharks were indeed captured as bycatch), but more recently there have been increased efforts devoted to developing and evaluating bycatch reduction strategies for sharks. Research activity was most common in the North Atlantic (*40 {\%} of the total articles analysed) with comparatively less research in other areas such as the Indo-Pacific region where shark bycatch is regarded as particularly common and problematic. Most studies were observational with comparatively fewer exper- imental and modeling studies, and even fewer that combined research approaches. Gear modifications (e.g., hook size and type for long lines, net size and mesh design for nets) were the most commonly evaluated strategy for reducing shark bycatch; how- ever, development and use of techniques like repel- lents, or seasonal area closures, or a combination of strategies, offer interesting possibilities that require further study. In addition, although many sharks are discarded, little is known about post-release survival or sub-lethal consequences of fisheries interactions, or evaluations of different fish handling strategies, mak- ing it difficult to quantify the true cost of bycatch or to recommend handling strategies to fishers. Although there are some inherent challenges with developing and testing shark bycatch reduction strategies, there is an urgent need to do so and this would be best achieved through interdisciplinary research that spans field, laboratory, and modeling realms. papers that met our},

abstract = {Since the landmark contributions of Homer Smith and co-workers in the 1930s there has been a considerable advance in our knowledge regarding the osmoregulatory strategy of elasmobranch fish. Smith recognised that urea was retained in the body fluids as part of the `osmoregulatory ballast' of elasmobranch fish so that body fluid osmolality is raised to a level that is iso- or slightly hyper-osmotic to that of the surrounding medium. From studies at that time he also postulated that many marine dwelling elasmobranchs were not capable of adaptation to dilute environments. However, more recent investigations have demonstrated that, at least in some species, this may not be the case. Gradual acclimation of marine dwelling elasmobranchs to varying environmental salinities under laboratory conditions has demonstrated that these fish do have the capacity to acclimate to changes in salinity through independent regulation of Naq , Cly and urea levels. This suggests that many of the presumed stenohaline marine elasmobranchs could in fact be described as partially euryhaline. The contributions of Thomas Thorson in the 1970s demonstrated the osmoregulatory strategy of a fully euryhaline elasmobranch, the bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas, and more recent investigations have examined the mechanisms behind this strategy in the euryhaline elasmobranch, Dasyatis sabina. Both partially euryhaline and fully euryhaline species utilise the same physiological processes to control urea, Naq and Cly levels within the body fluids. The role of the gills, kidney, liver, rectal gland and drinking process is discussed in relation to the endocrine control of urea, Naq and Cly levels as elasmobranchs acclimate to different environmental salinities.},

abstract = {Biodiversity science is unusual in that an emerging paradigm is not based on a specific process, but rather depends largely on stochastic elements, perceived as neutral forces. Here I suggest that these forces, which have been justified, in part, by the concepts of symmetry and equalizing mechanisms, have application to the understanding of stochastic models but do not constitute forces that operate in nature. Another process now regularly classified as a neutral force, limited dispersal, represents a fundamental demographic process that is not neutral with respect to species differences, but rather differs among species in important ways. Finally, I suggest that the dramatic shift in ecological research to focus on neutrality could have a cost in terms of scientific understanding and relevance to real biodiversity threats.},

abstract = {The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model with smoothing is introduced for modeling count data with many zero-valued observations, and its use is illustrated with shark bycatch data from the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna purse-seine fishery for 1994-2004. Based on the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility of the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data, standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model fit. Comparison of trends among models suggests that the negative binomial regression model may overestimate model coefficients when fitted to data with many zero-valued observations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long-term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15-30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long-term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.},

abstract = {In addition to fostering biodiversity goals, marine protected area (MPA) implementation has economic consequences for both commercial and recreational fisheries. During the implementation of the State of California (USA) Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA), which mandates the creation of an MPA network in California's state waters, the stakeholders and policymakers utilized a pair of economic analyses that addressed these considerations. One was a comparative, static assessment of short-term, " worst case" potential socioeconomic impacts to important fisheries based on surveys of local fishermen. This analysis made no assumptions about fishery management outside of MPAs, assumed no spillover of fish from MPAs into fished areas or reallocation of fishing effort, and estimated the maximum potential dollar-value economic impacts over a short time scale. The other was a dynamic, bioeconomic assessment of the changes in spatial distribution of biomass and catch, based on published biological parameter values, oceanographic models of larval connectivity, and a range of possible levels of fishing. This analysis explicitly accounted for fish population dynamics, spillover, fisher movement, and fishery management outside of the MPAs, but was limited to long-term, equilibrium-based results because of a lack of baseline abundance data. Both evaluation methods were novel in their spatial resolution and their use directly in an MPA design process, rather than after implementation. The two methods produced broadly similar (at a regional spatial scale) evaluations of the likely effects of proposed MPAs on fisheries, at least when the bioeconomic model assumed fishery management was conservative. Our experience with these analyses in the MLPA Initiative process led to several suggestions for future MPA design efforts: (i) since the change in fish biomass inside MPAs partly depends on fisheries management outside of them, it is useful to integrate or coordinate conventional fishery management and MPA planning efforts; (ii) integrate modeling assessments early into MPA design, as part of a post-implementation adaptive management approach; and (iii) integrate empirical fishery data into bioeconomic models in order to improve representations of human behavior and short-term forecasts of changes in fished populations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Dasyatis violacea, with few age classes, was used to demonstrate the basics of Leslie-matrix and stage-based matrix model calculations. The demography for Carcharias taurus, with a 2-year reproductive cycle, produced higher potential population growth using actual fertility rather than effective annual fertility. The demography for Alopias pelagicus, with continuous reproduction, produced higher potential population growth for a birth-flow than a birth-pulse population. The Carcharodon carcharias example demonstrated only a small difference in potential population growth between step-like and logistic fertility functions. Stage-based models with fixed stage duration produced potential population growths identical to those obtained from a life-history table or Leslie matrix, but the net reproductive rates and generation times differed. Stage-based models with few stages had different dynamics with shorter recovery to the stable age distribution; they underestimated the elasticity of juvenile survival and overestimated the elasticity of adult survival, suggesting that interpretation should be cautious. Elasticity analyses were used to estimate the number of juvenile age classes that could be fished and have the same effect on potential population growth as fishing all the adult age classes.},

Movements of nutrients, detritus, prey, and consumers among habitats are ubiquitous in diverse biomes and can strongly influence population, consumer-resource, food web, and community dynamics. Nutrient and detrital subsidies usually increase primary and secondary productivity, both directly and indirectly. Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support. Top-down effects occur when spatially subsidized consumers affect local resources by suppressing key resources and occasionally by initiating trophic cascades. Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure. Landscape variables such as the perimeter/area ratio of the focal habitat, permeability of habitat boundaries, and relative productivity of trophically connected habitats affect the degree and importance of spatial subsidization.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are assumed to protect a wide range of species from deleterious effects stemming from exploitation. However, some species, due to their ecological characteristics, may not respond positively to protection. Very little is known about the effects of life history and ecological traits (e.g., mobility, growth, and habitat) on responses of fish species to marine reserves. Using 40 data sets from 12 European marine reserves, we show that there is significant variation in the response of different species of fish to protection and that this heterogeneity can be explained, in part, by differences in their traits. Densities of targeted size-classes of commercial species were greater in protected than unprotected areas. This effect of protection increased as the maximum body size of the targeted species increased, and it was greater for species that were not obligate schoolers. However, contrary to previous theoretical findings, even mobile species with wide home ranges benefited from protection: the effect of protection was at least as strong for mobile species as it was for sedentary ones. Noncommercial bycatch and unexploited species rarely responded to protection, and when they did (in the case of unexploited bentho-pelagic species), they exhibited the opposite response: their densities were lower inside reserves. The use of marine reserves for marine conservation and fisheries management implies that they should ensure protection for a wide range of species with different life-history and ecological traits. Our results suggest this is not the case, and instead that effects vary with economic value, body size, habitat, depth range, and schooling behavior.},

not compromised, offering the possibility of swift recovery. However, prolonged intense overexploitation, especially for collapsed stocks, not only delays rebuilding but also substantially increases the uncertainty in recovery times, despite predictable influences of fishing and life history.

Empirical evidence suggests that positive feedbacks may make such transitions difficult to reverse. We developed a mathematical model of grassland dynamics in which one group of species (native) is a better competitor for nitrogen (N) and another group (exotic) is a better competitor for light. We parameterized the model for a grassland community and reproduced observed transitions from a native- to an exotic-dominated state under N loading. Within known bounds of parameter values, both smooth and hysteretic transitions are plausible. The model also predicts that N loading alone is insufficient to achieve a transition to an exotic-dominated state on a timescale relevant to grassland management (a few decades), and that therefore some other disturbance (e.g., fire suppression or heaving grazing) must be present to accelerate it. The model predicts that to restore a grassland to a native-dominated state after N inputs have been reduced, fire and carbon supplements would be most effective. Further field research in N-enriched invaded grasslands is required to establish the strengths of positive feedbacks and, in turn, the consequences of anthropogenic modification of grasslands worldwide.},

-debate over whether density dependent factors and competion (niche overlap) matter in a world of constant environmental changes
-{\textgreater} at some scale niche differences are needed to explain coexistence

-They discuss hypotheses of a number of key classic papers (e.g. Hutchinson)

-harsh conditions lower pop ggrowth but also lower competition among similar species

They argue that harshness is not have a general trend in how it will affect a community, it depends

-Discuss how species can have temporal niches

-Use general LV model that includes variable environment models and lottery models, but is more general than either

Results
-Look at an important model ration mu/b, where my is effect of density-independent factors and b is effect of competition
-harshness does not prevent competitive exclusion, but it may slow rate of exclusion

Discuss more exotic noise processes besides stationary time series (see Halley 1996)

Discussion of classic papers:
Hutchinson - he thought environmental fluctuatinos should alrter rank order of competition and allow coexistence, this paper predicts competitve exclusion

Huston - 

Grime (1979) - was mostly interested in stress (reduction in biomass production) and disturbance (removal of biomass), beleived competition would be highest in low stress, low disturbance environments

Hubbell - thinks coexistence occurs b//c slow species species extinction

Alternative models to their general setup:
Look at three scenarios that may permit major effects of harshness or fluctuations:
1) flructuations and resource partioning
2) predators as a niche dimension - predators may act differently depending on density of prey species
3) nonadditivity (e.g. the storage effect) - fluctuations matter if their is nonlinear response (basicially discussion of Jensen's inequlaity), go through some math as well
4) spatial variation casued by disturbance},

The probability of extinction for a single population in a continuous habitat was compared to that of multiple isolated, or semi-isolated, populations occupying a fragmented landscape with an equivalent total carrying capacity. Populations occupying a fragmented landscape were modelled for a range of dispersal rates and levels of asynchrony in the effects of environmental disturbances. Dispersal among subpopulations in the fragmented landscape partially alleviates the effect of fragmentation on extinction rates, despite the models explicitly incorporating disease epidemics which spread between subpopulations through dispersal. Even moderate environmental correlations among subpopulations greatly reduces the viability of the metapopulation relative to the case where the populations are totally independent. Whether a population performed better as a single population or as a metapopulation was strongly affected by the carrying capacity assumed, the time frame examined and the initial fitness of the population. A single population always fared better when the total habitat available was capable of supporting ≤1000 adults. Thus, continued habitat fragmentation can be expected to fuel the ongoing global extinction crisis and conservation efforts should be aimed at interconnecting isolated habitat patches.},

abstract = {Understanding the adaptations that allow species to live in temporally variable environments is essential for predicting how they may respond to future environmental change. Variation at the intergenerational scale can allow the evolution of bet-hedging strategies: a novel genotype may be favoured over an alternative with higher arithmetic mean fitness if the new genotype experiences a sufficiently large reduction in temporal fitness variation; the successful genotype is said to have traded off its mean and variance in fitness in order to 'hedge its evolutionary bets'. We review the evidence for bet-hedging in a range of simple plant systems that have proved particularly tractable for studying bet-hedging under natural conditions. We begin by outlining the essential theory, reiterating the important distinction between conservative and diversified bet-hedging strategies. We then examine the theory and empirical evidence for the canonical example of bet-hedging: diversification via dormant seeds in annual plants. We discuss the complications that arise when moving beyond this simple case to consider more complex life-history traits, such as flowering size in semelparous perennial plants. Finally, we outline a framework for accommodating these complications, emphasizing the central role that model-based approaches can play.},

Conservative bet-hedging is risk avoidance at an indivdual level. Diversified bet-hedging is when risk is spread amonst many indidviuals of the same genotype (e.g. see dromancy in annual plants). There are a number of difficulties when examining taxa with complicated life histories (i.e. not annual plants with seed banks).},

Successful uses of the basic simplification procedure are illustrated. Wretched consistent approximations are presented, showing that the procedure can be misused. The situation is clarified by a discussion of the relation between the size of the residual and the goodness of the approximation in three simple problem classes. Section 2 discusses scaling : how to choose dimensionless variables in such a way that the relative size of the various terms in an equation is explicitly indicated by the magnitudes of the dimensionless parameters which precede them. Scaling is illustrated on a simple physical problem and on several known functions. It is pointed out that more than one scale may be necessary, and the connection with singular perturbation theory is established. Advice is given on circumventing the dilemma of choosing scales for the unknown functions which comprise the solution of the very problem whose investigation one is trying to facilitate by appropriate scaling.},

abstract = {1. Population growth rate is determined by both density-dependent and density-independent processes. In the temperate zone, the strength and spatial scale of these processes are likely to differ seasonally, but such differences have rarely been quantitatively examined. 2. Coverage, the area occupied by organisms, is a measure of resource use in sessile marine populations. Population models used for density-based studies should be able to characterize effectively fluctuations in coverage, but few have tried to apply such models to sessile populations. 3. We observed coverage of the intertidal barnacle Chthamalus challengeri at 20 plots on four shores along the Pacific coast of Japan over 8 years. We then fitted a population model that incorporated both a density-dependent process (strength of density dependence) and density-independent processes (intrinsic growth rate and stochastic fluctuation at different spatial scales) to these data to analyse the seasonal variation of these processes and answer the following two questions: (i) How do the effects of density-dependent and density-independent processes on population growth vary seasonally? (ii) At what spatial scale, regional (tens of kilometres), shore (hundreds of metres), or rock (tens of centimetres), does density-independent stochastic fluctuation most strongly affect population size changes? 4. Barnacle population size tended to decrease in summer, when population dynamics were characterized by a relatively lower intrinsic growth rate, weaker density dependence and stronger stochastic fluctuation. In contrast, population size tended to increase in winter, reflecting a higher intrinsic growth rate, strong density dependence and weak stochastic fluctuation. 5. In summer, population growth rate was strongly affected by regional-scale stochastic fluctuation, whereas in winter it was affected more by rock-scale stochastic fluctuation, suggesting that populations were strongly affected by regional-scale processes in summer but not in winter. 6. These results indicate that seasonally variable density-dependent and density-independent processes determine the population dynamics of C. challengeri. Therefore, to understand fluctuation patterns of populations of this species, seasonality should be taken into account. Moreover, this study demonstrates that population models commonly used for density-based studies are also applicable to coverage-based population studies.},

Here, we review the literature to disentangle the actions of evolutionary changes in response to selection induced by climate change versus changes due to individual plasticity, that is, the capacity of an individual to adjust its phenology to environmental variables. Within the abundant literature on climate change effects on bird phenology, only a small fraction of studies are based on individual data, yet individual data are required to quantify the relative importance of plastic versus evolutionary responses. While plasticity seems common and often adaptive, no study so far has provided direct evidence for an evolutionary response of bird phenology to current climate change. This assessment leads us to notice the alarming lack of tests for microevolutionary changes in bird phenology in response to climate change, in contrast with the abundant claims on this issue. In short, at present we cannot draw reliable conclusions on the processes underlying the observed patterns of advanced phenology in birds. Rapid improvements in techniques for gathering and analysing individual data offer exciting possibilities that should encourage research activity to fill this knowledge gap.},

abstract = {Climate change is likely to alter wildfire regimes, but the magnitude and timing of potential climate-driven changes in regional fire regimes are not well understood. We considered how the occurrence, size, and spatial location of large fires might respond to climate projections in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem (GYE) (Wyoming), a large wildland ecosystem dominated by conifer forests and characterized by infrequent, high-severity fire. We developed a suite of statistical models that related monthly climate data (1972-1999) to the occurrence and size of fires {\textgreater}200 ha in the northern Rocky Mountains; these models were cross-validated and then used with downscaled (∼12 km × 12 km) climate projections from three global climate models to predict fire occurrence and area burned in the GYE through 2099. All models predicted substantial increases in fire by midcentury, with fire rotation (the time to burn an area equal to the landscape area) reduced to {\textless}30 y from the historical 100-300 y for most of the GYE. Years without large fires were common historically but are expected to become rare as annual area burned and the frequency of regionally synchronous fires increase. Our findings suggest a shift to novel fire-climate-vegetation relationships in Greater Yellowstone by midcentury because fire frequency and extent would be inconsistent with persistence of the current suite of conifer species. The predicted new fire regime would transform the flora, fauna, and ecosystem processes in this landscape and may indicate similar changes for other subalpine forests.},

In the face of these declines, identification of nursery areas for this species is of particular importance to ensure the implementation of protective measures that will maximize survival of young individuals to maturity. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to assess the emergence of Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury (PKD) Bay, Massachusetts, USA, as a seasonal nursery for juvenile sand tigers that migrate north from southern parturition grounds. Seasonal residency, habitat use, and site fidelity of 73 acoustically tagged juvenile sand tigers (78 to 108 cm fork length) were monitored within PKD Bay during 4 seasonal periods from 2008 to 2011. Eight individuals were tracked in multiple years, with 2 individuals returning to PKD Bay in 3 consecutive years. Sand tigers remained in PKD Bay for periods of 1 to 124 d and displayed a high degree of site fidelity to 2 core habitats during each year of the study. Weekly activity space estimates were relatively constant throughout each yearly monitoring period, with a general increase prior to emigration of sharks from the embayment. Emigration of sharks from PKD Bay was significantly related to both day length and water temperature. Collectively, these results suggest that PKD Bay constitutes a seasonal nursery area for juvenile sand tigers and warrants the extension of juvenile sand tiger essential fish habitat north of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA.},

Adult R. taylori also persist in the bay, a behavioural pattern possibly explained by their small maximum size. While present immediately after birth the type of utilisation pattern displayed by Sphyrna lewini could not be clarified in this study. Although diets of these species in the bay are similar, there is probably little direct competition for food due to the highly productive habitats in the bay supporting an abundance of food resources.

abstract = {Many studies have recorded phenotypic changes in natural populations and attributed them to climate change. However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing - and exclusion - of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known - and not known - about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed - and these must employ better inferential methods - before general conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we hope that the present paper and special issue provide inspiration for future research and guidelines on best practices for its execution.},

Although biodiversity has been associated with stability, the actual structures and processes that confer stability to diverse food webs remain largely unknown. Here we show that real food webs are structured such that top predators act as couplers of distinct energy channels that differ in both productivity and turnover rate. Our theoretical analysis shows that coupled fast and slow channels convey both local and non-local stability to food webs. Alarmingly, the same human actions that have been implicated in the loss of biodiversity also directly erode the very structures and processes that we show to confer stability on food webs.},

abstract = {Conservation of marine resources is critical to the wellbeing of human communities. Coastal artisanal fishing communities are particularly reliant on marine resources for food and for their livelihoods. Management actions aimed at marine conservation may lead to unanticipated changes in human behavior that influence the ability of conservation programs to achieve their goals. We examine how marine conservation strategies may impact labor decisions that influence both the ecosystem and human livelihoods using simulation modeling. We consider two conservation strategies in the model: direct action through fisheries regulation enforcement, and indirect action through land conservation. Our results indicate that both strategies can increase the abundance of fish, and thus contribute to the maintenance of marine resources. However, our results also show that marine fisheries enforcement may negatively impact the livelihoods of human communities. Land conservation, on the other hand, potentially enhances the livelihood of the human populations. Thus, depending on management objectives, indirect or a combination of direct and indirect conservation strategies may be effective at achieving conservation and sustainability goals. These results highlight the importance of accounting for changes in human behavior resulting from management actions in conservation and management.},

abstract = {Institutes often lack funds and manpower to perform large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Citizens can be involved, contributing to the collection of data, thus decreasing costs. Underwater research requires specialist skills and SCUBA certification, and it can be difficult to involve volunteers. The aim of this study was to involve large numbers of recreational divers in marine biodiversity monitoring for increasing the environmental education of the public and collecting data on the status of marine biodiversity. Here we show that thousands of recreational divers can be enrolled in a short time. Using specially formulated questionnaires, nonspecialist volunteers reported the presence of 61 marine taxa encountered during recreational dives, performed as regular sport dives. Validation trials were carried out to assess the accuracy and consistency of volunteer-recorded data, and these were compared to reference data collected by an experienced researcher. In the majority of trials (76{\%}) volunteers performed with an accuracy and consistency of 50-80{\%}, comparable to the performance of conservation volunteer divers on precise transects in other projects. The recruitment of recreational divers involved the main diving and tour operators in Italy, a popular scientific magazine, and mass media. During the four-year study, 3825 divers completed 18757 questionnaires, corresponding to 13539 diving hours. The volunteer-sightings-based index showed that in the monitored area the biodiversity status did not change significantly within the project time scale, but there was a significant negative correlation with latitude, suggesting improved quality in the southernmost areas. This trend could be related to the presence of stressors in the northern areas and has been supported by investigations performed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The greatest limitation with using volunteers to collect data was the uneven spatial distribution of samples. The benefits were the considerable amounts of data collected over short time periods and at low costs. The successful development of citizen-based monitoring programs requires open-mindedness in the academic community; advantages of citizen involvement in research are not only adding large data sets to the ecological knowledge base but also aiding in the environmental education of the public.},

abstract = {Sharks and other large predators are scarce on most coral reefs, but studies of their historical ecology provide qualitative evidence that predators were once numerous in these ecosystems. Quantifying density of sharks in the absence of humans (baseline) is, however, hindered by a paucity of pertinent time-series data. Recently researchers have used underwater visual surveys, primarily of limited spatial extent or nonstandard design, to infer negative associations between reef shark abundance and human populations. We analyzed data from 1607 towed-diver surveys ({\textgreater}1 ha transects surveyed by observers towed behind a boat) conducted at 46 reefs in the central-western Pacific Ocean, reefs that included some of the world's most pristine coral reefs. Estimates of shark density from towed-diver surveys were substantially lower ({\textless}10{\%}) than published estimates from surveys along small transects ({\textless}0.02 ha), which is not consistent with inverted biomass pyramids (predator biomass greater than prey biomass) reported by other researchers for pristine reefs. We examined the relation between the density of reef sharks observed in towed-diver surveys and human population in models that accounted for the influence of oceanic primary productivity, sea surface temperature, reef area, and reef physical complexity. We used these models to estimate the density of sharks in the absence of humans. Densities of gray reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), whitetip reef sharks (Triaenodon obesus), and the group "all reef sharks" increased substantially as human population decreased and as primary productivity and minimum sea surface temperature (or reef area, which was highly correlated with temperature) increased. Simulated baseline densities of reef sharks under the absence of humans were 1.1-2.4/ha for the main Hawaiian Islands, 1.2-2.4/ha for inhabited islands of American Samoa, and 0.9-2.1/ha for inhabited islands in the Mariana Archipelago, which suggests that density of reef sharks has declined to 3-10{\%} of baseline levels in these areas.},

abstract = {Many elasmobranchs have experienced strong population declines, which have been largely attributed to the direct and indirect effects of exploitation. Recently, however, live elasmobranchs are being increasingly valued for their role in marine ecosystems, dive tourism and intrinsic worth. Thus, management plans have been implemented to slow and ultimately reverse negative trends, including shark-specific (e.g. anti-finning laws) to ecosystem-based (e.g. no-take marine reserves) strategies. Yet it is unclear how successful these measures are, or will be, given the degree of depletion and slow recovery potential of most elasmobranchs. Here, current understanding of elasmobranch pop- ulation recoveries is reviewed. The potential and realized extent of population increases, including rates of increase, timelines and drivers are evaluated. Across 40 increasing populations, only 25{\%} were attributed to decreased anthropogenic mortality, while the majority was attributed to predation release. It is also shown that even low exploitation rates (2--6{\%} per year) can halt or reverse positive population trends in six populations currently managed under recovery plans. Management mea- sures that help restore elasmobranch populations include enforcement or near-zero fishing mortality, protection of critical habitats, monitoring and education. These measures are highlighted in a case study from the south-eastern U.S.A., where some evidence of recovery is seen in Pristis pectinata, Galeocerdo cuvier and Sphyrna lewini populations. It is concluded that recovery of elasmobranchs is certainly possible but requires time and a combination of strong and dedicated management actions to be successful.},

Despite theory linking temporal environmental fluctuations with the maintenance of diversity, the importance of climate variability for stabilizing coexistence remains unknown because of a lack of appropriate long-term observations. Here, we analyze three decades of demographic data from a Kansas prairie to demonstrate that interannual climate variability promotes the coexistence of three common grass species. Specifically, we show that (i) the dynamics of the three species satisfy all requirements of "storage effect" theory based on recruitment variability with overlapping generations, (ii) climate variables are correlated with interannual variation in species performance, and (iii) temporal variability increases low-density growth rates, buffering these species against competitive exclusion. Given that environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous in natural systems, our results suggest that coexistence based on the storage effect may be underappreciated and could provide an important alternative to recent neutral theories of diversity. Field evidence for positive effects of variability on coexistence also emphasizes the need to consider changes in both climate means and variances when forecasting the effects of global change on species diversity.},

abstract = {Many ecological systems are characterized by brief periods of increased resource availability called resource pulses. Empirical studies suggest that some populations of primary consumers grow rapidly in response to resource pulses, but others instead remain at low abundance despite increases in resource availability. Previous theory suggests that the lack of increase in primary consumers might be due to predators, which can respond to increased prey density both numerically, by increasing their own population, and functionally, by killing prey at a faster rate. The complexity of potential population responses to resource pulses can be assessed with simulations, but analytical conditions determining when one observes qualitatively distinct dynamics have yet to be identified. Here we use a graphical method based on a bifurcation diagram to derive the conditions leading to qualitatively distinct steady state and transient prey population dynamics as levels of predation (abundance and diversity) vary. When predation thresholds are crossed, consumer populations respond numerically to increases in their resources and provide a secondary resource pulse to their predators and parasites. These community dynamics have broad implications for the impact of changing predator communities on insect and rodent population outbreaks, which are economically and epidemiologically important.},

abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a basic tool of current conservation practice. However, if not accounted for properly, the uncertainties inherent to PVA predictions can decrease the reliability of this type of analysis. In the present study, we performed a PVA of the whole western European population (France, Portugal, and Spain) of the endangered Bonelli's Eagle ($\backslash$emph{\{}Aquila fasciata{\}}), in which we thoroughly explored the consequences of uncertainty in population processes and parameters on PVA predictions. First, we estimated key vital rates (survival, fertility, recruitment, and dispersal rates) using monitoring, ringing, and bibliographic data from the period 1990--2009 from 12 populations found throughout the studied geographic range. Second, we evaluated the uncertainty about model structure (i.e., the assumed processes that govern individual fates and population dynamics) by comparing the observed growth rates of the studied populations with model predictions for the same period. Third, using the model structures suggested in the previous step, we assessed the viability of both the local populations and the overall population. Finally, we analyzed the effects of model and parameter uncertainty on PVA predictions. Our results strongly support the idea that all local populations in western Europe belong to a single, spatially structured population operating as a source-- sink system, whereby the populations in the south of the Iberian Peninsula act as sources and, thanks to dispersal, sustain all other local populations, which would otherwise decline. Predictions regarding population dynamics varied considerably, and models assuming more constrained dispersal predicted more pessimistic population trends than models assuming greater dispersal. Model predictions accounting for parameter uncertainty revealed a marked increase in the risk of population declines over the next 50 years. Sensitivity analyses indicated that adult and pre-adult survival are the chief vital rates regulating these populations, and thus, the conservation efforts aimed at improving these survival rates should be strengthened in order to guarantee the long-term viability of the European populations of this endangered species. Overall, the study provides a framework for the implementation of multi-site PVAs and highlights the importance of dispersal processes in shaping the population dynamics of long-lived birds distributed across heterogeneous landscapes.},
annote = {-study combines a number of techniques to conduct a PVA analysis on eagle populations in western Europe
        
Methods
This study examines a Bonelli's Eagle metapopulation in Eastern Europe. A number of sites have been well studied of the past twenty years (1990-2005). They utilize a number of techniques that are extremely relevant to our pika metapopulation work (ex. using specific dispersal kernels to allow eagles to disperse according to distance, birds only disperse once; they are also territorial). Have a five stage model with fledglings, juveniles, immature, subadult and adult (construct model based on age like my shark model). Parameter estimates are made from past studies and beta distributions were used to simulate survivals while a stretched beta distribution was used for productivities. Each site in model had a maximum number of possible breeding pairs (similar to pika model). Use a total of six different models that include various elements: closed or connected population, density dependence, shape of natal dispersal kernel, and the ability for birds to be able to disperse more than once. Population growth rate was used as a pattern to evaluate model success. The model ranking was determined by comparing the negative log likelihoods of each model. The study also identified conservation targets by changing vital rates and comparing patterns of sensitivity and elasticity. 
        
Results
Means and standard errors were calculated for each parameter. The natal dispersal kernel was best fit with the exponential model (lambda=9.75 x 10{\^{}}-3). Their best model could explain 79 percent of the observed variance. The different populations were shown to be at high risk or no risk for quasi-extinction over the next 50 years. As expected, adult survival and pre-adult survival vital rates were the most important in terms of conservation targets. Overall, the population acted as a source-sink system.

Although many countries have established no-take marine reserves, a paucity of monitoring data means it is still unclear if reserves are effectively protecting these species. We examined data collected by a small group of divers over the past 21 years at one of the world's oldest marine protected areas (MPAs), Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica. We used mixed effects models to determine trends in relative abundance, or probability of occurrence, of 12 monitored elasmobranch species while accounting for variation among observers and from abiotic factors. Eight of 12 species declined significantly over the past 2 decades. We documented decreases in relative abundance for 6 species, including the iconic scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) (-45{\%}), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) (-77{\%}), mobula ray (Mobula spp.) (-78{\%}), and manta ray (Manta birostris) (-89{\%}) rays, and decreases in the probability of occurrence for 2 other species. Several of these species have small home ranges and should be better protected by an MPA, which underscores the notion that declines of marine megafauna will continue unabated in MPAs unless there is adequate enforcement effort to control fishing. In addition, probability of occurrence at Cocos Island of tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and whale (Rhincodon typus) sharks increased significantly. The effectiveness of MPAs cannot be evaluated by examining single species because population responses can vary depending on life history traits and vulnerability to fishing pressure.},

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

To analyze and explain this phenomenon a discrete stage- structured model of Tribolium dynamics with periodic environmental forcing is introduced and studied. This model is an appropriately modified version of an experimentally validated model for flour beetle populations growing in a constant volume of flour, in which cannibalism rates are assumed inversely proportional to flour volume. This modeling assumption has been confirmed by laboratory experiments. Theorems implying the existence and stability of periodic solutions of the periodically forced model are proved, The time averages of periodic solutions of the forced model are compared with the equilibrium levels of the unforced model (with the same average flour volume). Parameter constraints are determined for which the average population numbers in the periodic environment are greater than (or less than) the equilibrium population numbers in the associated constant environment, Sample parameter estimates taken from the literature show that these constraints are fulfilled. These theoretical results provide an explanation for the experimentally observed increase in flour beetle numbers as a result of periodically fluctuating flour volumes. More generally, these integrated theoretical and experimental results provide the first convincing example illustrating the possibility of increased population numbers in a periodically fluctuating environment},

abstract = {Abstract
Genetic diversity (h), effective population size (Ne), and contemporary levels of gene flow are important parameters to estimate for species of conservation concern, such as the globally endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini. Therefore, we have reconstructed the demographic history of S. lewini across its Eastern Pacific (EP) range by applying classical and coalescent population genetic methods to a combination of 15 microsatellite loci and mtDNA control region sequences. In addition to significant population genetic structure and isolation-by-distance among seven coastal sites between central Mexico and Ecuador, the analyses revealed that all populations have experienced a bottleneck and that all current values of h are at least an order of magnitude smaller than ancestral h, indicating large decreases in Ne (h = 4Nem), where m is the mutation rate. Application of the isolation-with-migration (IM) model showed modest but significant genetic connectivity between most sampled sites (point estimates of Nm=0.1--16.7), with divergence times (t) among all populations significantly greater than zero. Using a conservative (i.e., slow) fossil-based taxon-specific phylogenetic calibration for mtDNA mutation rates, posterior probability distributions (PPDs) for the onset of the decline in Ne predate modern fishing in this region. The cause of decline over the last several thousand years is unknown but is highly atypical as a post-glacial demographic history. Regardless of the cause, our data and analyses suggest that S. lewini was far more abundant throughout the EP in the past than at present.},

A lack of data and complicated jurisdictional issues present particular challenges for assessing and conserving high seas biodiversity. It is clear, however, that pelagic sharks and rays of the open ocean are subject to high and often unrestricted levels of mortality from bycatch and targeted fisheries for their meat and valuable fins.
2. These species exhibit a wide range of life-history characteristics, but many have relatively low productivity and consequently relatively high intrinsic vulnerability to over-exploitation. The IUCN World Conservation Union Red List criteria were used to assess the global status of 21 oceanic pelagic shark and ray species.
3. Three-quarters (16) of these species are classified as Threatened or Near Threatened. Eleven species are globally threatened with higher risk of extinction: the giant devilray is Endangered, ten sharks are Vulnerable and a further five species are Near Threatened. Threat status depends on the interaction between the demographic resilience of the species and intensity of fisheries exploitation.
4. Most threatened species, like the shortfin mako shark, have low population increase rates and suffer high fishing mortality throughout their range. Species with a lower risk of extinction have either fast, resilient life histories (e.g. pelagic stingray) or are species with slow, less resilient life histories but subject to fisheries management (e.g. salmon shark).
5. Recommendations, including implementing and enforcing finning bans and catch limits, are made to guide effective conservation and management of these sharks and rays.},

Both phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution can underlie rapid phenological shifts in response to climate change, but their relative contributions are poorly understood. Here, we combine a continuous 38 year field survey with quantitative genetic field experiments to assess adaptation in the context of climate change. We focused on Boechera stricta (Brassicaeae), a mustard native to the US Rocky Mountains. Flowering phenology advanced significantly from 1973 to 2011, and was strongly associated with warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt dates. Strong directional selection favoured earlier flowering in contemporary environments (2010-2011). Climate change could drive this directional selection, and promote even earlier flowering as temperatures continue to increase. Our quantitative genetic analyses predict a response to selection of 0.2 to 0.5 days acceleration in flowering per generation, which could account for more than 20 per cent of the phenological change observed in the long-term dataset. However, the strength of directional selection and the predicted evolutionary response are likely much greater now than even 30 years ago because of rapidly changing climatic conditions. We predict that adaptation will likely be necessary for long-term in situ persistence in the context of climate change.},

abstract = {The use of demographic analyses incorporating life history information on validated age and growth, reproduction, and natural mortality is proposed to gain insight into the population dynamics of sharks under a variety of scenarios and to assess their vulnerability to varying exploitation rates. This approach provides a useful framework for comparison with other currently used methods of assessment, especially those that rely only on fishery-dependent data, and thus can be helpful to stock assessments and to the rational exploitation and management of shark stocks. A review of demographic analyses of large coastal sharks on the east coast of the US indicates that the lemon and sandbar sharks have very low rates of population increase (r{\textless}1.2{\%} year-1) and are thus extremely vulnerable to exploitation. In contrast, one of the small coastal group species of lesser importance to the fisheries, the bonnethead shark, has some of the highest r values yet calculated for any shark. Preliminary demographic analyses using nonvalidated age estimates indicate that two other common and economically valuable large coastal species, the blacktip and dusky sharks, may also exhibit relatively slow rates of population change and be very vulnerable to overexploitation. Improved assessment of shark stocks requires increased collection of biological and fishery data, and a much better understanding of their population dynamics, especially stock$\backslash$pmrecruitment relationships. 5 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We analyse the concept of carrying capacity (CC), from populations to the biosphere, and offer a definition suitable for any level. For communities and ecosystems, the CC evokes density-dependence assumptions analogous to those of population dynamics. At the biosphere level, human CC is uncertain and dynamic, leading to apprehensive rather than practical conclusions. The term CC is widely used among ecological disciplines but remains vague and elusive. We propose the following definition: the CC is 'the limit of growth or development of each and all hierarchical levels of biological integration, beginning with the population, and shaped by processes and interdependent relationships between finite resources and the consumers of those resources'. The restrictions of the concept relate to the hierarchical approach. Emergent properties arise at each level, and environmental heterogeneity restrains the measurement and application of the CC. Because the CC entails a myriad of interrelated, ever-changing biotic and abiotic factors, it must not be assumed constant, if we are to derive more effective and realistic management schemes. At the ecosystem level, stability and resilience are dynamic components of the CC. Historical processes that help shape global biodiversity (e.g. continental drift, glaciations) are likely drivers of large-scale changes in the earth's CC. Finally, world population growth and consumption of resources by humanity will necessitate modifications to the paradigm of sustainable development, and demand a clear and fundamental understanding of how CC operates across all biological levels.},

We identify areas where management applications using elasticity analysis potentially conflict with the mathematical basis of the technique, and we use a hypothetical example and three real data sets (Prairie Chicken [Tympanuchus cupido], desert tortoise [Gopherus agassizii],and killer whale [Orcinus orca]) to evaluate the extent to which conservation recommendations based on elasticities might be misleading. First, changes in one demographic rate can change the qualitative ranking of the elasticity val- ues calculated from a population matrix, a result that dampens enthusiasm for ranking conservation actions based solely on which rates have the highest elasticity values. Second, although elasticities often provide accurate predictions of future changes in population growth rate under management perturbations that are large or that affect more than one rate concurrently, concordance frequently fails when different rates vary by different amounts. In particular, when vital rates change to their high or low values observed in nature, predictions offuture growth rate based on elasticities of a mean matrix can be misleading, even predicting population increase when the population growth rate actually declines following a perturbation. Elasticity measures will continue to be useful tools for applied ecologists, but they should be interpreted with consider- able care. We suggest that studies using analytical elasticity analysis explicitly consider the range of variation possible for different rates and that simulation methods are a useful tool to this end.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests that Pacific harbor seals Phoca vitulina are likely to alter their for- aging behavior in response to seasonal prey pulses. We hypothesized that spawning herring Clu- pea pallasii aggregations are seasonally important prey for harbor seals, predicting that (1) harbor seal consumption of adult herring would peak during the spawning season, (2) harbor seals would seasonally change their foraging areas to take advantage of spawning herring aggregations, and (3) seal diving behavior would reflect the vertical distribution of herring during the spawning sea- son. The predictions were tested using an analysis of harbor seal prey remains, GPS telemetry, and satellite-linked time/depth recorder data. Contrary to predictions, herring in harbor seal diet was comprised of 74{\%} juveniles and 26{\%} adults in the spawn season, versus 37{\%} juveniles and 63{\%} adults in the post-spawn season. Harbor seal use of documented herring areas was highest during the season when herring did not spawn, and seal diving behavior did not reflect the verti- cal distribution of herring. The lack of response by harbor seals to spawning herring pulses is likely explained by the low energy density of adult herring during the spawn season, and the availability of profitable alternative prey such as juvenile herring. This study highlights the influ- ence of relative prey profitability on the foraging behavior of harbor seals, and may help to explain why predators do not always respond as predicted to resource pulses.},

There was a strong correlation between the number of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) observed by dive guides and the telemetry data at both daily and monthly intervals, suggesting that variation in relative abundance of sharks was detectable in datasets collected by dive guides in a similar manner to data derived from telemetry at these time scales. There was no correlation between the number or mean depth of sharks recorded by telemetry and the presence of tourist divers, suggesting that the behaviour of sharks was not affected by the presence of divers during our study. Data recorded by dive guides showed that current strength and temperature were important drivers of the relative abundance of sharks at monitored sites.

We then use an epidemiological model, in which observed absolute humidity conditions temper influenza transmission rates, to successfully simulate the seasonal cycle of observed influenza-related mortality. The model results indicate that direct modulation of influenza transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is sufficient to produce this observed seasonality.

The approach treats succession as a series of state transitions driven by both the internal dynamics of species interactions and external forcing. First, I motivate the approach with numerical solutions of a seasonally forced predator-prey model. Second, I describe how to set up and analyze an SSD model. Finally, I apply the techniques to three additional models of two-species interactions: resource competition (r-K selection), facilitation, and flip-flop competition (where the competitive hierarchy alternates over time). This approach allows easy and thorough exploration of how dynamics depend on the environmental forcing regime, and uncovers unexpected phenomena such as multiple stable annual trajectories and year-to-year irregularity in successional trajectories (chaos). ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fire and fire management are recognized as important factors in biodiversity conservation. Measuring species-level demographic, behavioural and population responses to different fire regimes is essential for designing adequate management policies. Here we assessed the impact of fire on survival rates, repro- duction and movement patterns in Testudo graeca, an endangered terrestrial tortoise inhabiting the Mediterranean region, a system in which fire plays a relevant role in the functioning of their ecosystems. Then we predicted the probabilities of quasi-extinction of T. graeca under several fire regimes and population sizes by means of stochastic population models. Our results showed that fire caused direct and delayed reductions in local survival, young individuals being the most affected. There were not differences in fecundity and movement patterns of tortoises between burned and unburned areas. Population models showed a strong variation in the probability of quasi-extinction of populations depending on the fire regime and the population size. Under fire frequencies similar to those occurring in the wild ({\textless}1 fire every 20--30 years) most tortoise populations seemed to buffer the effects of fires. However, when this threshold value of fire frequency was surpassed, the probability of quasi-extinction of populations exploded for all populations, except for those with the largest sizes. T. graeca populations may be able to cope with natural current fire frequencies, but the effects of more recurrent fires may severely threaten the species. Our results have straightforward applications for fire management pur- poses in those areas of the Mediterranean region where this endangered species is present.},

abstract = {Community-level resilience depends on the interaction between multiple populations that vary in individual responses to disturbance. For example, in tropical reefs, some corals can survive higher stress (resistance) while others exhibit faster recovery (engineering resilience) following disturbances such as thermal stress. While each type will negatively affect the other through competition, each might also benefit the other by reducing the potential for an additional competitor such as macroalgae to invade after a disturbance. To determine how community composition affects ecological resilience, we modeled coral-macroalgae interactions given either a resistant coral, a resilient coral, or both together. Having both coral types (i.e., response diversity) can lead to observable enhanced ecological resilience if (1) the resilient coral is not a superior competitor and (2) disturbance levels are high enough such that the resilient coral would collapse when considered alone. This enhanced resilience occurs through competitor-enabled rescue where each coral increases the potential for the other to recover from disturbance through external recruitment, such that both corals benefit from the presence of each other in terms of total cover and resilience. Therefore, conservation management aimed at protecting resilience under global change requires consideration of both diversity and connectivity between sites experiencing differential disturbance.},

Evaluations typically compare abundance inside versus outside or after versus before implementation, but the temporal and spatial scales over which these measures can reflect marine protected area success are untested. We modeled the response of fished populations for a range of marine protected area sizes, fishing intensities, larval dispersal distances, and adult movement ranges. Our results, which can inform experimental design and interpretation of monitoring, show that the spatial and temporal scale of population responses to marine protected areas will be determined by simple relationships between marine protected area size, larval and adult movement distances, and generation time, in addition to the effects of exploitation rate. The largest effects of marine protected areas should be expected with ‘outside' samples located at least 2 dispersal units from the edge, and after 2 generations have passed since establishment. In general, monitoring studies over time (after versus before) should provide better assessment of marine protected area success than monitoring over space (inside versus outside), but understanding of the limitations of each type of measurement is key. Because it may take many years for marine protected area effects to be fully realized, we strongly caution against judgment of marine protected area effectiveness at inappropriately short time frames. },

abstract = {The question of how dispersal evolved has a rich history, but the answer has certainly not been established. This dissertation addresses an important subsidiary question, how much information about the local environment (patch) should an organism living in a metapopulation use when 'deciding' whether or not to disperse? More precisely, what behavioral response to proximate cues for dispersal are evolutionary attracting? The first objective of the following study is to define precisely what an evolutionary attractor is. Then, three metapopulation dynamics models are derived and analyzed. A technique is developed which allows one to use these population dynamics models to investigate the properties of evolutionarily attracting dispersal strategies. THe results of this dissertation indicate that although density dependent dispersal strategies are often, but not always, superior tot the best density independent strategy, even moderate costs associated with the former strategy reverse the superiority. In some cases, the evolutionary mechanism has difficulty differentiating between a density dependent strategy and the best density independent one. In such cases the system possesses two stable evolutionary attractors. These results suggest that the best density independent strategy makes efficient use of the metapopulation resources in the form of vacant territories. As a result, basing dispersal on local resources confers little advantage, and may even be disadvantageous. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect to find density independent strategies in nature. Also, it is shown that the models obey a classical average individual fitness principle, but such a fitness concept is highly dependent on population dynamics. A more precise concept of fitness in the context of these models is the dominant Lyapunov exponent definition outlined in recent literature. It is shown that this concept retains the essential properties of the classical concept of fitness. In addition to these results, a comparison of the models implies that sufficient spatial or temporal variation in patch occupancy is necessary for the development and evolutionary maintenance of a nonzero dispersal strategy, and demographic stochasticity is sufficient to supply that variation only when patch sizes are small. The evolutionary attracting (EA) dispersal strategy is sensitive to variation in average patch size; as patches increase in size, EA dispersal fractions decrease rapidly. The EA dispersal strategy is also highly sensitive to direct costs of dispersal. Again, the EA dispersal fraction drops rapidly with probability of mortality during dispersal.},

This definition is accompanied by a mechanistic framework based on the concept that extreme response thresholds associated with significant community change and altered ecosystem function must be crossed in order for an ECE to occur. 4. Synthesis. A definition and mechanistic framework for ECEs is used to identify priorities for future research that will enable ecologists to more fully assess the ecological consequences of climate extremes for ecosystem structure and function today and in a future world where their frequency and intensity are expected to increase.},

While correlative studies of local extinction have been vital to understanding the ecological impacts of global change, more mechanistic lines of inquiry are needed for enhanced forecasting. The current study assesses whether the predictors of local extinction also explain population density for a species apparently impacted by climate change. We tested a suite of climatic and habitat metrics as predictors of American pika (Ochotona princeps) relative population density in the Southern Rocky Mountains, USA. Population density was indexed as the density of pika latrine sites. Negative binomial regression and AICc showed that the best predictors of pika latrine density were patch area followed by two measures of vegetation quality: the diversity and relative cover of forbs. In contrast with previous studies of habitat occupancy in the Southern Rockies, climatic factors were not among the top predictors of latrine density. Populations may be buffered from decline and ultimately from extirpation at sites with high- quality vegetation. Conversely, populations at highest risk for declining density and extirpation are likely to be those in sites with poor-quality vegetation.},

abstract = {The Arctic is now experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on earth. Over the next 100 years, climate change is expected to accelerate, contributing to major physical, ecological, social, and economic changes, many of which have already begun. Changes in arctic climate will also affect the rest of the world through increased global warming and rising sea levels. Arctic Climate Impact Assessment was prepared by an international team of over 300 scientists, experts, and knowledgeable members of indigenous communities. The report has been thoroughly researched, is fully referenced, and provides the first comprehensive evaluation of arctic climate change, changes in ultraviolet radiation and their impacts for the region and for the world. It is illustrated in full color throughout. The results provided the scientific foundations for the ACIA synthesis report - Impacts of a Warming Arctic - published by Cambridge University Press in 2004.},

abstract = {Populations need to adapt to sustained climate change, which requires micro-evolutionary change in the long term. A key question is how the rate of this micro-evolutionary change compares with the rate of environmental change, given that theoretically there is a 'critical rate of environmental change' beyond which increased maladaptation leads to population extinction. Here, we parametrize two closely related models to predict this critical rate using data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major). We used stochastic dynamic programming to predict changes in optimal breeding time under three different climate scenarios. Using these results we parametrized two theoretical models to predict critical rates. Results from both models agreed qualitatively in that even 'mild' rates of climate change would be close to these critical rates with respect to great tit breeding time, while for scenarios close to the upper limit of IPCC climate projections the calculated critical rates would be clearly exceeded with possible consequences for population persistence. We therefore tentatively conclude that micro-evolution, together with plasticity, would rescue only the population from mild rates of climate change, although the models make many simplifying assumptions that remain to be tested.},

abstract = {A latitudinal gradient in biodiversity has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs, yet how and why this gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},
annote = {The latitudal gradient in biodiversity has remained unexplained. There are two current hypotheses to why it may exist. The time and area hypothesis says the gradient arises from the fact that tropical climates are older and larger which allows for more diversity. The diversification rate hypothesis argues that speciation rates are faster in the tropics. 
        
Evolutionary and historical explanations have reemerged because of the lack of support for ecological hypotheses to explain the gradient. 
        
Longer durations in the tropical habitats of the world do not seem to explain all of the diversity gradient observed. Therefore speciation rates might be what differs on the globe. 
        
Dispersal rates should be higher in species at higher latitudes? Interesting
        
Higher temps may also drive higher extinction rates. },

This is surprising as empty patches are needed for an inferior species to colonize. 

        
Instead of two species, you could use the same model to examine two phenotypes. This could provide insight of how a disperser phenotype may start to dominate if there is habitat loss. It is unclear to me if a species like a lionfish would increase or decrease in face of habitat degragation. Are they the better competitor or colonizer?

abstract = {Question: How are competing foragers expected to distribute their lifetime foraging effort on a gradient of resource types that differ in abundance, quality, foraging costs, and associated mortality risks? Mathematical method: Population dynamics of foragers and resources coupled with adaptive dynamics of foraging strategies based on continuous, function-valued traits. Key assumptions: We start from generalizing the classical patch-based theory of optimal foraging to continuous resource gradients following the traditional assumptions of constant renewal rates of resources, spatially homogeneous mortality risks, and of foragers that are omniscient, free to move without costs, equal, and not experiencing any saturation of intake. We then relax the restrictive assumptions of the classical model, thus accounting for nonlinear functional responses of the foragers, heterogeneous mortality risks and resource qualities, energetically costly foraging, genetic covariances constraining foraging, feedbacks between foraging and resource dynamics, and different types of competition between foragers. Results: (1) When expressed as instantaneous rates with the same units (time-1), mortality risks (d), foraging costs (c), and resource qualities (q) all influence the evolutionarily stable distribution of foraging effort through the dimensionless expression (d+c)/q; (2) functional responses that imply intake saturation may result in a subset of resources remaining entirely unused; (3) coupling foraging to resource dynamics results in a rich array of evolutionary outcomes, depending on the type of competition among foragers and the inter-play between forager and resource characteristics; and (4) genetic constraints may cause foraging effort to track the resource gradient more coarsely than classical models predict.},

abstract = {Population limitation is a fundamental tenet of ecology, but the relative roles of exogenous and endogenous mechanisms remain unquantified for most species. Here we used multi-model inference (MMI), a form of model averaging, based on information theory (Akaike's Information Criterion) to evaluate the relative strength of evidence for density-dependent and density-independent population dynamical models in long-term abundance time series of 1198 species. We also compared the MMI results to more classic methods for detecting density dependence: Neyman-Pearson hypothesis-testing and best-model selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion or cross-validation. Using MMI on our large database, we show that density dependence is a pervasive feature of population dynamics (median MMI support for density dependence = 74.7-92.2{\%}), and that this holds across widely different taxa. The weight of evidence for density dependence varied among species but increased consistently, with the number of generations monitored. Best-model selection methods yielded similar results to MMI (a density-dependent model was favored in 66.2-93.9{\%} of species time series), while the hypothesis-testing methods detected density dependence less frequently (32.6-49.8{\%}). There were no obvious differences in the prevalence of density dependence across major taxonomic groups under any of the statistical methods used. These results underscore the value of using multiple modes of analysis to quantify the relative empirical support for a set of working hypotheses that encompass a range of realistic population dynamical behaviors.},

abstract = {Three high-flow experiments (HFEs) were conducted by the U.S. Department of the Interior at Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona, in March 1996, November 2004, and March 2008 (figs. 1 and 2). These experiments, also known as artificial or controlled floods, were large-volume, sched­uled releases of water from Glen Canyon Dam that were designed to mimic some aspects of pre-dam Colorado River seasonal flooding. The goal of these experiments was to determine whether high flows could be used to benefit important physical and biological resources in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Grand Canyon National Park (fig. 2) that had been affected by the operation of Glen Canyon Dam. Efforts such as HFEs that seek to maintain and restore downstream resources are undertaken by the U.S. Department of the Interior under the auspices of the Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 (GCPA; title XVIII, secs. 1801–1809, of Public Law 102-575). Scientists conducted a wide range of monitoring and research activities before, during, and after the experiments. Initially, research efforts focused on whether HFEs could be used to rebuild and maintain Grand Canyon sandbars, which provide camping beaches for hikers and whitewater rafters, create habitats poten­tially used by native fish and other wildlife, and are the source of windborne sand that may help to protect some archaeological resources from weathering and erosion. As scientists gained a better understanding of how HFEs affect the physical environment, research efforts expanded to include additional investigations about the effects of HFEs on biological resources, such as native fishes, nonnative sports fishes, riverside vegetation, and the aquatic food web. The chapters that follow summarize and synthesize for decisionmakers and the public what has been learned about HFEs to provide a framework for implementing similar future experiments. This report is a product of the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program (GCDAMP), a Federal initiative authorized to ensure that the primary mandate of the GCPA (GCPA sec. 1802 (a)) is met through advances in information and resource management. The program and its research efforts focus on a study area that encompasses the Colorado River corridor from the forebay of Glen Canyon Dam to the western boundary of Grand Canyon National Park, which is identified as the Colorado River ecosystem elsewhere in this report. The study area includes the approximately 16-mile river corridor between the dam and Lees Ferry within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and the entire 277-river mile corridor downstream from Lees Ferry and within Grand Canyon National Park (fig. 2). The U.S. Geological Survey's Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center (GCMRC) is responsible for the scientific moni­toring and research efforts of the GCDAMP, including the preparation of this report. The GCMRC gratefully acknowledges the contributions of those scientists with Federal and State resource-management agencies, academic institutions, and private consulting firms who undertook much of the research presented in the chapters that follow.},

For three species that showed declining catch rates or length the potential effect of the shark nets was assessed to be low, suggesting that other sources of catchwere responsible for the declining status.The potential effect of the shark nets was assessed to be high for two species (Carcharhinus obscurus and Carcharias taurus, neither of which showed declines in catch rate or length), because of very low intrinsic rates of population increase},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Sharks are often regarded as opportunistic asynchronous predators that feed on the most abundant prey. In the present study, 2 populations of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevi- rostris were investigated from Bimini, Bahamas, with well-defined home ranges facilitating the esti- mation of prey preference. Stomach contents were quantitatively analysed from 396 lemon sharks with data on prey species and abundance obtained from quantitative sampling of mangrove and sea- grass faunal communities to elucidate preferences with respect to prey type, prey size and location. Yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus dominated the diet of juvenile lemon sharks ({\textgreater}50{\%} by weight and percentage index of relative importance, {\%}IRI), even when present in lower abundances in the environment. Preference was determined and compared using abundance, {\%}IRI values and original weight of prey, with the latter preferred due to their close relationship with energetic intake. Juve- nile lemon sharks do not feed indiscriminately, but exhibit prey preference and size selection. Juve- nile lemon sharks at Bimini demonstrated a hierarchy of prey preference: parrotfish (Scaridae) {\textgreater} mojarra (Gerreidae) {\textgreater} toadfish (Batrachoididae) {\textgreater} filefish (Balistidae) {\textgreater} grunts (Haemulidae) {\textgreater} bar- racuda (Sphyraenidae). High overlap between shark diet and mangrove communities revealed the importance of mangroves to lemon sharks and their prey. Lemon sharks fed disproportionately on intermediate sized teleosts and crustaceans, with maximum prey size of nursery-bound sharks pri- marily limited by availability in the environment. We conclude that sharks can be highly plastic for- agers, capable of selective feeding, but will switch to more opportunistic foraging when environmen- tal conditions deteriorate.

abstract = {Most animal populations have distinct breeding and non-breeding periods, yet the implications of seasonality on population dynamics are not well understood. Here, we introduce an experimental model system to study the population dynamics of two important consequences of seasonality: sequential density dependence and carry-over effects (COEs). Using a replicated seasonal population of Drosophila, we placed individuals at four densities in the non-breeding season and then, among those that survived, placed them to breed at three different densities. We show that COEs arising from variation in non-breeding density negatively impacts individual performance by reducing per capita breeding output by 29-77{\%}, implying that non-lethal COEs can have a strong influence on population abundance. We then parametrized a bi-seasonal population model from the experimental results, and show that both sequential density dependence and COEs can stabilize long-term population dynamics and that COEs can reduce population size at low intrinsic rates of growth. Our results have important implications for predicting the successful colonization of new habitats, and for understanding the long-term persistence of seasonal populations in a wide range of taxa, including migratory organisms.},

abstract = {We used a spatially explicit population model that was generalized to produce nine ecological profiles of long-lived species with stable home ranges and natal dispersal to investigate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on population dynamics. We simulated population dynamics in landscapes composed of three habitat types (good-quality habitat ranging from 10–25{\%}, poor-quality habitat ranging from 10– 70{\%}, and matrix). Landscape structures varied from highly fragmented to completely contiguous. The specific aims of our model were (1) to investigate under which biological circumstances the traditional approach of using two types only (habitat and matrix) failed and assess the potential impact of restoring matrix to poor- quality habitat, (2) to investigate how much of the variation in population size was explained by landscape composition alone and which key attributes of landscape structure can serve as predictors of population r esponse, and (3) to estimate the maximum fragmentation effects expressed in equivalent pure loss of good- quality habitat. Poor-quality habitat mattered most in situations when it was generally not considered (i.e., fo r metapopulations or spatially structured populations when it provides dispersal habitat). Population size increased up to 3 times after restoring matrix to poor-quality habitat. Overall, habitat amount accounted fo r 68{\%} of the variation in population size, whereas ecological profile and fragmentation accounted for approximately 13{\%} each. The maximal effect of (good-quality) habitat fragmentation was equivalent to a pure loss of up to 15{\%} of good-quality habitat, and the maximal loss of individuals resulting from maximal fragmentation reached 80{\%}. Abundant dispersal habitat and sufficiently large dispersal potential, however, r esulted in functionally connected landscapes, and maximal fragmentation had no effect at all. Our findings suggest that predicting fragmentation effects requires a good understanding of the biology and habitat use of the species in question and that the uniqueness of species and the landscapes in which they live confound simple analysis.},

The relationship between PDO and population growth was nonlinear. Populations declined in years with extreme winter PDO values, when there were either extremely warm or extremely cold sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific relative to that in the western Pacific.

We found evolutionary divergence in the expression of alternative male reproductive morphs-fighters and defenceless scramblers (sneakers)-caused by the selective harvesting of each male morph. Regardless of which morph was targeted, the direction of evolution of male morph expression in response to harvesting was always towards scramblers, which, in case of the harvesting of scramblers, we attributed to strong ecological feedback (reduced cannibalism opportunities for fighters) within the closed populations. Current evolutionary theory, however, predicts that the frequency of a morph always decreases when selected against: to understand phenotypic trait evolution fully, evolutionary theory would benefit from including ecological interactions, especially if traits have ecological consequences that in turn feedback to their evolutionary trajectory. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

No epidemic can occur if the population density is below this threshold value.

In recent years, the probability of detecting defined population trends has been the most common method of assessing monitoring programs. Such analyses require many assumptions, including a model for population change and a model for variance. To demonstrate potential effects of these assumptions on power analysis results, we present data for Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) from Tern Island, Hawaii. Depending on our assumptions, the power to detect a 50{\%} decline over 10 years varied from 80{\%} to 100{\%}. We argue that monitoring standards based upon the ability to detect population trends should be applied cautiously. As a complementary approach, we propose that monitoring standards should emphasize attributes of sampling design that increase precision (e.g., randomization, bias, and detection probability). By using standards of precision, managers can focus on the sources of variation that can be minimized. A sampling design approach to monitoring standards provides a useful complement to standards of statistical power to detect annual trends.},

Available information on evolutionary rescue was rare and restricted to abundant and highly fecund species that faced severe intentional anthropogenic selective pressures. However, examples from adaptive tracking in common species and genetic rescues in species of conservation concern provide convincing evidence in favour of the mechanisms of evolutionary rescue. We conclude that low population size, long generation times and limited genetic variability will result in evolutionary rescue occurring rarely for endangered species without intervention. Owing to the risks presented by current environmental change and the possibility of evolutionary rescue in nature, we suggest means to study evolutionary rescue by mapping genotype → phenotype → demography → fitness relationships, and priorities for applying evolutionary rescue to wild populations.},

abstract = {Models of population divergence and speciation are often based on the assumption that differences between populations are due to genetic factors, and that phenotypic change is due to natural selection. It is equally plausible that some of the differences among populations are due to phenotypic plasticity. We use the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to review the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution. Moderate levels of phenotypic plasticity are optimal in permitting population survival in a new environment and in bringing populations into the realm of attraction of an adaptive peak. High levels of plasticity may increase the probability of population persistence but reduce the likelihood of genetic change, because the plastic response itself places the population close to a peak. Moderate levels of plasticity arise whenever multiple traits, some of which are plastic and others not, form a composite trait involved in the adaptive response. For example, altered behaviours may drive selection on morphology and physiology. Because there is likely to be a considerable element of chance in which behaviours become established, behavioural change followed by morphological and physiological evolution may be a potent force in driving evolution in novel directions. We assess the role of phenotypic plasticity in stimulating evolution by considering two examples from birds: (i) the evolution of red and yellow plumage coloration due to carotenoid consumption; and (ii) the evolution of foraging behaviours on islands. Phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and may speed up, slow down, or have little effect on evolutionary change. Moderate levels of plasticity may often facilitate genetic evolution but careful analyses of individual cases are needed to ascertain whether plasticity has been essential or merely incidental to population differentiation.},
annote = {"If individuals can attain high fitness in the new environment as a consequence of a plastic response, it is not obvious why there should be directional selection at all, and there would then be no adaptive genetic differentiation from the source."
-genetic adaptation occurs if there is a cost to plasticity or if plasticity is inadequate

-Focuses on invasive species, or species inhabitating new environments
-Point out that plasticity may allow initial transition

-pllasticity can allow shifts to other adaptive peaks (it could be a lower peak though that you could maybe not get off of?)

"The observation that plasticity is present does not, in itself, indicate if it would enhance or slow down evolution- ary progress, because this also depends on the form of the adaptive surface"

-provide examples on carotenoids in birds and
-foragin behaviors of animals in novel environments (behavior can change rapidly) - these behavior modifications then led to a genetic change

The longline fishery caught a large number of mahi-mahi (Coryphaena sp.) and silky sharks, but also caught a large number of olive ridley turtles and pelagic stingrays (Pteroplatytrygon violacea). We esti- mated that longline fisheries caught 699,600 olive ridleys, including 92,300 adult females, from 1999 to 2010. These captureswere associatedwith a decline of nesting populations atnearby arribada beaches. Therewere sta- tistically significant size decreases from1999 to 2010 inmature olive ridley turtles and from2003 to 2010 in silky sharks. Average fork length of silky sharks in 2010 was 97.3 cm, which was far below observed fork length at maturity, 144 cm. Pelagic thresher sharks were small and fluctuated in size over the study period. Capture of large numbers of juvenile blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) indicated a nursery area near the Osa Peninsula. Geospatial analysis indicated shifts inmahi-mahi abundanceona temporal scalebutfishing efforts didnot shiftwith the shift in mahi-mahi abundance. Yellowfintuna(Thunnus albacares), Indo-Pacific bluemarlin (Makairamazara) and Indo-Pacificsailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) catches varied seasonally and were most abundant out to sea and south of Panama. Marine protected areas and/or time area closures are needed to reduce the impact of the Costa Rican longline fishery on sea turtles and sharks.},

abstract = {Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with com-plex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Ev-idence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed disper-sal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differen-tial postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental eco-logical processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.},

abstract = {Abstract Habitat fragmentation is becoming increasing- ly common, yet, the effect of habitat spatial structure on population dynamics remains undetermined for most species. Populations of a single species found in frag- mented and nonfragmented habitat present a rare oppor- tunity to examine the effect of habitat spatial structure on population dynamics. This study investigates the impact of highly fragmented habitat on dispersal patterns, mat- ing behavior, and genetic variation in a pika (Ochotona princeps) population with a mainland-island spatial structure. Juvenile dispersal patterns in fragmented habi- tat revealed that individuals tended to disperse to neigh- boring habitat patches. However, within-patch band- sharing scores from multilocus DNA fingerprints did not differ from what would be expected if individuals were assorting randomly among habitat patches each year. Multiple, short-distance dispersal targets for juveniles and occasional long-distance dispersal events suggest that habitat fragmentation on this scale has not resulted in restricted dispersal and a genetically subdivided popu- lation. Although pikas tended to mate with the closest available partner, DNA fingerprinting band-sharing scores between mated pairs were consistent with a ran- dom mating hypothesis. Random mating in this popula- tion appears to be an incidental effect of dispersal in a fragmented habitat. This pattern is distinct from that found in nonfragmented habitat (large talus patches) where mating was non-random and consistent with mat- ing between individuals of intermediate relatedness. DNA fingerprinting data revealed within-species varia- tion in the mating habits of the pika directly attributable to habitat spatial structure.},

In the analysis presented here, the harmonic mean birth function is developed to incorporate size and sex specific fecundities. This structured birth function is compared with the harmonic mean birth function using both a hypothetical population and data for populations of the limpet Patella vulgata. A general expression to calculate the threshold value where the unstructured and the structured birth functions coincide is also provided. Using the structured birth function resulted in changes in population dynamics, growth rate, proportion of males and reproductive output. In conclusion, the choice of birth function is important due to its effects on the deterministic population characteristics, which in turn may have consequences for the managements of endangered or vulnerable species.},

abstract = {I. Four main points are dealt with :--(a) The widespread existence of fluctuations in the numbers of animals.(b) The existence, in many birds and mammals, of periodic fluctuations (p.f.).(c) The cause of the latter, which must be some periodic climatic change acting over wide areas.(d) The effects of fluctuations in general, and in particular of the p.f., on the method of evolution and other biological phenomena.2. A short sketch is given of what is known about short- period climatic cycles (2 to 20 years), and their causes.3. P.f. of lemmings have an average period of about 3[1/2] years. The maxima in numbers occur synchronously in North America and Europe, and probably all round the arctic regions.The varying hare in Canada has a period of 10 to 11 years.5. The only regular periods shown by the animals dealt with are the short one of 3[1/2] years and the longer one of 10 to 11 years. The former is probably more marked in the arctic and the other further south.6. The sandgrouse p.f. point to the existence of an 11-year climatic cycle in the deserts of Central Asia.7. The effects of these p.f. on evolution must be very great, although at present problematical; but the following suggestions are made :--(a) Natural selection of some characters must be periodic.(b) There will be different types of natural selection at the maxima and minima of numbers.(c) The struggle for existence, and therefore natural selection, tend to cease temporarily during the rapid expansion in numbers from a minimum, and new mutations have then a chance to get established and spread, i.e. without the aid of natural selection. This might happen only rarely.(d) This would explain the origin and survival of non adaptive characters in a species.(e) On the other hand periodic reduction in numbers will act as an important factor causing uniformity in the species.(f) The opposing factors (c) and (e) will vary much in different species, and the problem will require the combined attentions of mathematicians, and of ecologists working on the methods of regulation of the numbers of animals.(g) This mechanical uniformity factor, since it acts independently of natural selection, explains how a particular structure or habit may evolve, when it only has a general adaptive significance.},

Chapter 7: Spatial Point Pattern Analysis
- want to examine distribution of points in space and the possible interactions between the points
- test for complete spatial randomness, clustered, or regular patterns 
--G, F
--G function- measues the dist. of the distance from an event to its nearest event
--F funciton- measures the dist of all distance from an arbitrary point to its nearest event (measure of average space left between events)


First order props- measure distribution of events (e.g. intensity and spatial density)
2nd order props- measures interaction between points (clustering)


HPP and IPP Poisson point processes
-events are distributed independetly according to given intensity
-the intensity in an IPP varies spatially


HPP is stationary (intensity is constant and second-order intensity depends only on the relative positions of two points) and isotrophic (second-order intensity is invariant to rotation)
-{\textgreater} HPP is the formal defin. of a point process which is CSR


-can estimate intensity non-parametrically by kernal smoothing or parametrically by proposing a specific function for the intensity whose parameters are estimated by maxmizing the liklihood of the point process (min the MSE)
--the bandwidth is much more important than the kernal choice


Second order props (e.g. use K function)
-strength and type of interactions between pts
-prob of any pair of events occuring nearby pts x and y
-K function- measures number of events found up to a given dist from any particular event)




-Could use GAM to examine role of co variates in producing pattern




CHAPTER 8: GEOSTATISTICS
-pattern of locations is not of interest, want to examine the measurements of variables at each given point
-random fields, Z(s), Z is random, s is not
-try to estimate Z at unkown locations (s0)


Non-geostats. Interpolation methods
-inverse distance weighted interpolation (distance based weighted average at each point)- produces similar results to variogram with small nugget
-linear regression
-trend surface analysis (linear regression but with polynomial terms)




Variogram (usually semivariogram) examines spatial correlation


-need to assume stationarity in order the estimate spatial correlation (says variance of Z is constant and spatial correlation does not depend on location), isotrophy is also helpful
-to ensure only non-negative prediction variance, the matrix of semivariance values needs to be non-negative definite
-the nuggest represents measurement error and/or microvariability


Mutivariable variogram modeling- use cross variogram to estimate semivariances


Can find the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of Z(s0) if we know the predictor values for s0, the covariance of Z(s) and the covariance vector of Z(s) and Z(s0)
--Kriging (simple, orginary, and universal)- R would choose which type would be appropraiate based on the info provided
--Can also do block and stratisfied kriging


Cross validation splits data into modelling (training) and validation sets


Geostatistical simulation- refers to simulation of possible outcomes of a random field


Can estimate error of variogram coefficients using model-based geostatistical predictions




Chapter 9: Areal Data and Spatial Autocorr
-examining data collected in plane that is divided up into neighborhoods (areal units) that is a tessellation of the whole area
-measure spatial autocorrelation between neighbors, then assign spatial weights to neighbors
the way the area is divided up can affect the results- modifiable areal unit problem
-Neighbors can be chosen via a number of different weights: queen contiguity, rook contiguity, distance
-islands need special considerations
-After establishing neighbors, you assign spatial weights (W weghts, binary)
-can examine spatial lags
-test for spatial autocorrelation- assume that the mean model of the data removes systemic spatial patterning (ignoring covariates may say you have spatial autocorrelation when you don't actually- Type I error- reject null accidently)
--Use Moran's I (global test): see text
"The approach taken most generally is to stan- dardise the observed value by subtracting the analytical expected value, and dividing the difference by the square root of the analytical variance for the spatial weights used, for a set of assumptions. The result is a standard deviate, and is compared with the Normal distribution to find the probability value of the observed statistic under the null hypothesis of no spatial dependence for the chosen spatial weights – most often the test is one-sided, with an alter- native hypothesis of the observed statistic being significantly greater than its expected value."


-Randomization assumption-
"the randomisation assumption, which differsfrom the simpler normality assumption by introducing a correction term based on the kurtosis of the variable of interest"


-Could also use MCMC to mix up neighbors
-Empirical rates


Can also use local tests of spatial autocorrelation- this would detect clusters or hotspots},

abstract = {Knowledge of the habitat use and migration patterns of large sharks is important for assessing the effectiveness of large predator Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), vulnerability to fisheries and environmental influences, and management of shark-human interactions. Here we compare movement, reef-fidelity, and ocean migration for tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, across the Coral Sea, with an emphasis on New Caledonia. Thirty-three tiger sharks (1.54 to 3.9 m total length) were tagged with passive acoustic transmitters and their localised movements monitored on receiver arrays in New Caledonia, the Chesterfield and Lord Howe Islands in the Coral Sea, and the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Satellite tags were also used to determine habitat use and movements among habitats across the Coral Sea. Sub-adults and one male adult tiger shark displayed year-round residency in the Chesterfields with two females tagged in the Chesterfields and detected on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, after 591 and 842 days respectively. In coastal barrier reefs, tiger sharks were transient at acoustic arrays and each individual demonstrated a unique pattern of occurrence. From 2009 to 2013, fourteen sharks with satellite and acoustic tags undertook wide-ranging movements up to 1114 km across the Coral Sea with eight detected back on acoustic arrays up to 405 days after being tagged. Tiger sharks dove 1136 m and utilised three-dimensional activity spaces averaged at 2360 km³. The Chesterfield Islands appear to be important habitat for sub-adults and adult male tiger sharks. Management strategies need to consider the wide-ranging movements of large (sub-adult and adult) male and female tiger sharks at the individual level, whereas fidelity to specific coastal reefs may be consistent across groups of individuals. Coastal barrier reef MPAs, however, only afford brief protection for large tiger sharks, therefore determining the importance of other oceanic Coral Sea reefs should be a priority for future research.},

abstract = {Much research has been devoted to identify the conditions under which selection favours flexible individuals or genotypes that are able to modify their growth, development and behaviour in response to environmental cues, to unravel the mechanisms of plasticity and to explore its influence on patterns of diversity among individuals, populations and species. The consequences of developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility for the performance and ecological success of populations and species have attracted a comparatively limited but currently growing interest. Here, I re-emphasize that an increased understanding of the roles of plasticity in these contexts requires a 'whole organism' (rather than 'single trait') approach, taking into consideration that organisms are integrated complex phenotypes. I further argue that plasticity and genetic polymorphism should be analysed and discussed within a common framework. I summarize predictions from theory on how phenotypic variation stemming from developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility may affect different aspects of population-level performance. I argue that it is important to distinguish between effects associated with greater interindividual phenotypic variation resulting from plasticity, and effects mediated by variation among individuals in the capacity to express plasticity and flexibility as such. Finally, I claim that rigorous testing of predictions requires methods that allow for quantifying and comparing whole organism plasticity, as well as the ability to experimentally manipulate the level of and capacity for developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility independent of genetic variation.Heredity advance online publication, 8 October 2014; doi:10.1038/hdy.2014.92.},

abstract = {We compared life-history traits and extinction risk of chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and chimaeras), a group of high conservation concern, from the three major marine habitats (continental shelves, open ocean and deep sea), controlling for phylogenetic correlation. Deep-water chondrichthyans had a higher age at maturity and longevity, and a lower growth completion rate than shallow-water species. The average fishing mortality needed to drive a deep-water chondrichthyan species to extinction (Fextinct) was 38-58{\%} of that estimated for oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Mean values of Fextinct were 0.149, 0.250 and 0.368 for deep-water, oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Reproductive mode was an important determinant of extinction risk, while body size had a weak effect on extinction risk. As extinction risk was highly correlated with phylogeny, the loss of species will be accompanied by a loss of phylogenetic diversity. Conservation priority should not be restricted to large species, as is usually suggested, since many small species, like those inhabiting the deep ocean, are also highly vulnerable to extinction. Fishing mortality of deep-water chondrichthyans already exploited should be minimized, and new deep-water fisheries affecting chondrichthyans should be prevented.},
annote = {The paper looks at chondrichthyans species found in the three major marine habiatas: continental shelves, open ocean, and deep sea. They found that deep-water chondrichthyans are much more susceptible to overfishing. This is primarily because of deep-water chondrichtyands having more K-selected life history traits. Reproductive mode and body size were correlated with extinction risk. It only takes about half the amount of fishing pressure required for continental and oceanic species to drive deep sea species to extinction.


Use F{\_}extinct, which is the fishing mortality neccessary to drive a species to extinction, as a measure of extinction risk. We could do something similar in the Cocos paper and compare F{\_}extinct versus species decline or increase.


Use F{\_}extinct as a reponse variable in a series of models that correct for phylogeny},

abstract = {1. The majority of general life-history models treat the environment as being invariable through time, even though temporal variation in selective agents could dramatically change the outcomes, e.g. in terms of optimal size and time at maturity. For herbivorous insects, seasonal differences in food quality are reasonably well described, but seasonal dynamics of top-down selective forces are poorly documented. 2. The present study attempted to quantify seasonal changes in predation risk of folivorous insect larvae in temperate forest habitats. In a series of field experiments, artificial larvae were exposed to predators, and the resulting bird-inflicted damage was recorded. The trials were repeated regularly throughout the course of two summers. 3. A distinct peak of larval mortality was recorded in mid-June (the nestling period for most insectivorous passerine birds), after which predation risk declined to a plateau of 20-30{\%} below the peak value. 4. The recorded pattern is interpreted as a consequence of seasonal changes in the number and behaviour of insectivorous birds, and the abundance of alternative food resources for these predators. 5. A quantitative analysis based on field data indicated that considering temporal variation in mortality in life-history models is crucial for obtaining realistic predictions concerning central life-history traits, such as final body size in different generations. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

@article{Hanski1998,
annote = {Although I have read Hanski's review paper before, in conjuction with my own work, it was interesting to read it again in the light of what we have discussed so far in the Core. I really like Hanski's progression from the simple Levin's model to more complicated models like the incidence function model. I was surprised he didn't explictly make the point that the Levin's model is essentially the logisitic model analague for populations. I also appreciated how Hanski explained why the study of metapopulations applies more generally in ecology and conservation biology. A lot has been developed since 1998, but the importance of local dynamics has become increasingly reconginized. I would hope that a recent review of the subject would highlight this point. 


One of the important points I had forgotten about was the idea of time lags in metapopulations. The idea here being that a metapopulation may be doomed to go extinct, but it may take a significant amount of time for that extinction to occur. With this delay, it is hard to know how long "transient dynamics" may actually last. Maybe no metapopulations will actually persist in nature, but they may persist long enough for us to think they are in fact at some equilibrium. 


I was thinking about how a metapopulation might be able to accomondate more species simply because heterogeneity exists with different numbers of each species occupying each patch. In other words, the metapopulation strucuture itself playing the role of spatial heterogeneity that would allow species to coexist. However, most metapopulations I know of are of single species. I'm not sure if this is a bias in how we study metapopulations or if only single species actually persist in metapopulations.},

@article{McDonald-Madden2011,
abstract = {Research on the allocation of resources to manage threatened species typically assumes that the state of the system is completely observable; for example whether a species is present or not. The majority of this research has converged on modeling problems as Markov decision processes (MDP), which give an optimal strategy driven by the current state of the system being managed. However, the presence of threatened species in an area can be uncertain. Typically, resource allocation among multiple conservation areas has been based on the biggest expected benefit (return on investment) but fails to incorporate the risk of imperfect detection. We provide the first decision-making framework for confronting the trade-off between information and return on investment, and we illustrate the approach for populations of the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) in Kerinci Seblat National Park. The problem is posed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which extends MDP to incorporate incomplete detection and allows decisions based on our confidence in particular states. POMDP has previously been used for making optimal management decisions for a single population of a threatened species. We extend this work by investigating two populations, enabling us to explore the importance of variation in expected return on investment between populations on how we should act. We compare the performance of optimal strategies derived assuming complete (MDP) and incomplete (POMDP) observability. We find that uncertainty about the presence of a species affects how we should act. Further, we show that assuming full knowledge of a species presence will deliver poorer strategic outcomes than if uncertainty about a species status is explicitly considered. MDP solutions perform up to 90{\%} worse than the POMDP for highly cryptic species, and they only converge in performance when we are certain of observing the species during management: an unlikely scenario for many threatened species. This study illustrates an approach to allocating limited resources to threatened species where the conservation status of the species in different areas is uncertain. The results highlight the importance of including partial observability in future models of optimal species management when the species of concern is cryptic in nature.},

Recent declines of large marine vertebrates that are of little or no commercial value, such as sea turtles, seabirds and marine mammals, have focused attention on the ecological impacts of incidental take, or bycatch, in global fisheries. In spite of the recognition of the problem of bycatch, few comprehen- sive assessments of its effects have been conducted. Many vulnerable species live in pelagic habitats, making surveys logistically complex and expensive. Bycatch data are sparse and our understanding of the demo- graphy of the affected populations is often rudimentary. These factors, combined with the large spatial scales that pelagic vertebrates and fishing fleets cover, make accurate and timely bycatch assessments difficult.

Chapter 6: Chemoreception
            Klimley begins this chapter by discussing sharks in popular culture and shark repellent history from WWII. He emphasizes that shark species may be more or less sensitive to blood or amino acids based on their diet. Klimley presents a study that looked at how a white shark responded to an odor trail. In general, the author puts more emphasis on how experiments were carried out and the results from them. The author then shifts his attention to the anatomy and physiology of chemoreception. He begins by describing the nares along with the incurrent and excurrent nostrils. He also explains the differences in nare structure between different elasmobranch species: benthic (wide circular nares) and neritic (slit-like nares). There is quite a bit of variance in the number of lamellae and the surface area of those lamellae in the olfactory organs of sharks and rays. In general, neritic species depend more on olfaction compared to epibenthic groups. The author goes on to describe how experiments on chemical sensitivity are conducted and the results from those experiments. He also discusses the ability of sharks to detect changes in salinity. Amino acids and amines were the chemicals most attractive to sharks. Sharks are actually attracted to the chemical metabolites given off by their favored prey items. Conversely, some chemicals, like those produced from sea cucumbers, can produce a negative response from a shark. Klimley ends the chapter describing the various ways chemicals can be detected by animals in the water (e.g. swimming straight for the chemical or a sinosodial pattern) and the various species that use these different strategies. There are two Spotlight sections in this chapter. The first discusses the history, development and current use of shark repellent. The second Spotlight examines a recent study that looked at the ability of sharks with a laterally elongated rostrum (i.e. hammerheads) to detect chemicals in the water. The study found that, because of their head structure, hammerheads are able to sample more water for chemicals as they swim.

The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. 2. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. 3. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4. The model is fitted to data from three butterfly metapopulations. The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate). The results suggest that local populations of the three butterflies in patches of 1 ha, which may support of the order of 1000 adult butterflies, have an expected lifetime of 20-100 years.},

abstract = {The question of how dispersal behavior is adaptive and how it responds to changes in selection pressure is more relevant than ever, as anthropogenic habitat alteration and climate change accelerate around the world. Inmetapopulationmodels where local populations are large, and thus local population size is measured in den- sities, density-dependent dispersal is expected to evolve to a single-threshold strat- egy, in which individuals stay in patches with local population density smaller than a threshold value and move immediately away from patches with local population den- sity larger than the threshold. Fragmentation tends to convert continuous populations into metapopulations and also to decrease local population sizes. Therefore we ana- lyze a metapopulation model, where each patch can support only a relatively small local population and thus experience demographic stochasticity.We investigated the evolution of density-dependent dispersal, emigration and immigration, in two scenar- ios: adult and natal dispersal. We show that density-dependent emigration can also evolve to a nonmonotone, “triple-threshold” strategy. This interesting phenomenon results from an interplay between the direct and indirect benefits of dispersal and the costs of dispersal.We also found that, compared to juveniles, dispersing adults may benefit more from density-dependent vs. density-independent dispersal strategies.},

abstract = {* ‘Will my study answer my research question?' is the most fundamental question a researcher can ask when designing a study, yet when phrased in statistical terms – ‘What is the power of my study?' or ‘How precise will my parameter estimate be?' – few researchers in ecology and evolution (EE) try to answer it, despite the detrimental consequences of performing under- or over-powered research. We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the ‘informativeness' of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions. * We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs. * Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly. * These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},

annote = {For the past half-century ecologists have argued about how density-dependence may affect population regulation. Although it is generally well-known that density-dependence must play some role, detecting it's presence in natural popualtion has proved difficult. When examining natural populations, nonlinearity and time lags can obsurcre possible density-dependence. 


-"population regulation is the presence of a long-term staionary probability distribution of pop densitities"
-attractor is a more general version of a table point equilibria (e.g. periodic, or limit, cycles)
-in a stochastic system, a deterministic atttractor becomes a stationary probability distribution of the population size or density


-density dependence = the dependence of per capita growth rate on present or past population densitities
--direct is negative effects
--inverse is positive effects


In order for density dependence to force regulation: 1) density dependence must be of the right sign 2) return tendency needs to be strong to counteract density-independent forces 3) lag time for return tendency to occur must not be too long. 




With more data, it has become clear that many population experience density-dependence. The length of the time series investigated is of critical importance, as longer time series detect more density effects. 


Complex systems can be examined by looking at the relative strength of endoedous versus exogenous forces. The degree of periodicity and stability are both important aspects of any complex system. The degree of stability is measured by the Lyapunov exponent (long-term average divergence rate). 




Discussion post:
-density depence when combined with nonlinearities and lags




It is interesting to read this paper with the ecological training we now receive. I take for granted that there was ever a debate whether density-dependence factors were present. It is encouraging that most people eventually went the way the data was pointing–that population regulation required density-dependence. Certainly, the question as to whether density-dependent versus independent factors has more of an effect on a given population is still of great interest. It was not too surprising to read that the longer the time series (i.e. more adequate data) led to actually identifying density-dependence in natural systems. However, this did make me rethink papers I've read in the past that claimed they found density-dependence, but used data on short time scales. The potential confounding variables of observation errors, nonlinear processes, and time or spatial lags are also of great concern. These issues make experiments difficult enough that I feel theory will have to lead the way. 


I enjoyed the explanation and clarification of all the different terms for equilbria and which apply in which contexts. Phrasing these types of questions in the terms of dynamical systems gives you a lot of useful tools and theory. 


The paper does such a good job at discussing the importance of stochasticity, but only in the context of describing the "ensemble mean" of a population density. I think identifying the role of density-dependence in driving the variance we observe in population density would be interesting.   The definitions for direct versus inverse density-dependence were a bit confusing. 


In the past, I have typically associated density-dependent factors being solely related to intrinsic processes. It makes sense that such factors could also be driven by external or environmental factors, as the paper makes clear.},

abstract = {The potential advantage of extreme value theory in modeling ecological disturbances is the central theme of this paper. The statistics of extremes have played only a very limited role in ecological modeling, despite the disproportionate influence of unusual disturbances on ecosystems. An overview of this theory is provided, with emphasis on recent developments that both make more efficient use of the available data on extremes and enable applications that are more ecologically realistic. Consistent with the emphasis on scale in ecology, scaling properties of extremes are emphasized. It is argued that the existence of distributions whose extreme upper tail is ‘‘heavy'' (i.e., decreases at a relatively slow rate) implies that ecological disturbances are sometimes regarded as more ‘‘surprising'' than they ought to be. The application focuses on modeling disturbances in paleoecology. Two examples are considered: the first, a sediment yield time series for Nicolay Lake in the high Arctic, reflects only the influence of hydrologic disturbances; the second, a sediment rate time series in the Chesapeake Bay, includes both climatic and anthropogenic influences. Strong evidence supports a heavy-tailed distribution for the Nicolay Lake sediment yield, but not necessarily for the Chesapeake Bay sediment rates. For each example, it is demonstrated how the statistics of extremes can readily incorporate information about covariates, such as large-scale atmospheric–oceanic circulation patterns or land use.},

abstract = {Listing endangered and threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act is presumed to offer a defense against extinction and a solution to achieve recovery of imperiled populations, but only if effective conservation action ensues after listing occurs. The amount of government funding available for species protection and recovery is one of the best predictors of successful recovery; however, government spending is both insufficient and highly disproportionate among groups of species, and there is significant discrepancy between proposed and actualized budgets across species. In light of an increasing list of imperiled species requiring evaluation and protection, an explicit approach to allocating recovery funds is urgently needed. Here I provide a formal decision-theoretic approach focusing on return on investment as an objective and a transparent mechanism to achieve the desired recovery goals. I found that less than 25{\%} of the {\$}1.21 billion/year needed for implementing recovery plans for 1,125 species is actually allocated to recovery. Spending in excess of the recommended recovery budget does not necessarily translate into better conservation outcomes. Rather, elimination of only the budget surplus for “costly yet futile” recovery plans can provide sufficient funding to erase funding deficits for more than 180 species. Triage by budget compression provides better funding for a larger sample of species, and a larger sample of adequately funded recovery plans should produce better outcomes even if by chance. Sharpening our focus on deliberate decision making offers the potential to achieve desired outcomes in avoiding extinction for Endangered Species Act-listed species. },

After the end of commercial whaling the population was thought to be recovering slowly; however, evidence indicates that it has been declining since about 1990 (ref. 1). There are now fewer than 300 individuals, and the species may already be functionally extinct2,3 owing to demographic stochasticity or the dif{\{}$\backslash$textregistered{\}}culty of females locating mates in the vast Atlantic Ocean (Allee effect4). Using a data set containing over 10,000 sightings of photographically identi{\{}$\backslash$textregistered{\}}ed individuals we estimated trends in right whale demographic parameters since 1980. Here we construct, using these estimates, matrix population models allowing us to analyse the causes of right whale imperil- ment. Mortality has increased, especially among mother whales, causing declines in population growth rate, life expectancy and the mean lifetime number of reproductive events between the period 1980$\backslash$pm1995. Increased mortality of mother whales can explain the declining population size, suggesting that the popula- tion is not doomed to extinction as a result of the Allee effect. An analysis of extinction time shows that demographic stochasticity has only a small effect, but preventing the deaths of only two female right whales per year would increase the population growth rate to replacement level.},

abstract = {We suggest that the conscious use of information that is ``hidden'' in distinct structures in nature itself and in data extracted from nature (=pattern) during the process of modeling (=pattern-oriented modeling) can substantially improve models in ecological application and conservation. Observed patterns, such as time-series patterns and spatial patterns of presence/absence in habitat patches, contain a great deal of data on scales, site-history, parameters and processes. Use of these data provides criteria for aggregating the biological information in the model, relates the model explicitly to the relevant scales of the system, facilitates the use of helpful techniques of indirect parameter estimation with independent data, and helps detect underlying ecological processes. Additionally, pattern-oriented models produce com- parative predictions that can be tested in the field.
We developed a step-by-step protocol for pattern-oriented modeling and illustrate the potential of this protocol by discussing three pattern-oriented population models: (1) a population viability analysis for brown bears (Ursus arctos) in northern Spain using time-series data on females with cubs of the year to adjust unknown model parame- ters; (2) a savanna model for detecting underlying ecological processes from spatial patterns of tree distribution; and (3) the incidence function model of metapopulation dynamics as an example of process integration and model generalization.
We conclude that using the pattern-oriented approach to its full potential will require a major paradigm shift in the strategies of modeling and data collection, and we argue that more emphasis must be placed on observing and documenting relevant patterns in addition to attempts to obtain direct estimates of model parameters.},

Yet despite burgeoning descriptions of these events, many of the proximate and ultimate causes of group living in these top predators remain elusive. Given the documented negative anthropogenic effects on many shark populations globally, there is an increasing need to understand how behaviourally mediated grouping influences population distributions and abundance, and the role this plays in exacerbating vulnerability to fishing mortality. Here, we analyse group living in elasmobranchs: we describe our current understanding of the patterns, mechanisms and functions of both aggrega- tion (where grouping is not driven by social mechanisms) and social grouping (where grouping is influenced by social interaction) and discuss some of the current methods used to study social behaviour in this taxa. In particular, social preferences in elasmobranchs have received relatively little attention. We propose that the study of shark aggregations may benefit from a more fine-scale analytical approach offered by detailed exploration of social interactions using social network analysis. Better understanding of the frequency and longevity of social relations, in conjunction with current long-term data on habitat use and site philopatry, will likely serve for a more informed approach to coastal and pelagic elasmobranch conservation initiatives.},

In many marine species, dispersal during the larval stage establishes links among populations and is largely determined by temporally variable fluid dynamic processes. However, the consequences of time-dependent dispersal for population persistence are largely unexplored, and so we present a model of stochastically driven dispersal to study population persistence in a temporally variable, patchy habitat. We illustrate how patterns of temporal autocorrelation, expressed as variance in stochastic population connectivity, can have counterintuitive consequences for predictions, where switching between two sets of dynamics, each of which leads to extinction, can promote metapopulation persistence. We contend that accounting for stochastic dispersal can have great relevance for understanding population persistence, in marine populations in particular and in organisms with some degree of passive dispersal in general.},

By fusing simulated and real animal behavior, we isolated predator effects while controlling for confounding factors. Prey with a tendency to be attracted toward, and to align direction of travel with, near neighbors tended to form mobile coordinated groups and were rarely attacked. These results demonstrate that collective motion could evolve as a response to predation, without prey being able to detect and respond to predators},

abstract = {Because sharks possess an unusual suite of reproductive characteristics, including internal fertilization, sperm storage, relatively low fecundity, and reproductive modes that range from oviparity to viviparity, they can provide important insight into the evolution of mating systems and sexual selection. Yet, to date, few studies have characterized behavioral and genetic mating systems in natural populations of sharks or other elasmobranchs. In this study, highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to examine breeding biology of a large coastal shark, the lemon shark, Negaplrion brevirostris, at a tropical lagoon nursery. Over six years, 910 lemon sharks were sampled and genotyped. Young were assigned into sibling groups that were then used to reconstruct genotypes of unsampled adults. We assigned 707 of 735 young sharks to one of 45 female genotypes (96.2{\%}), and 485 (66.0{\%}) were assigned to a male genotype. Adult female sharks consistently returned to Bimini on a biennial cycle to give birth. Over 86{\%} of litters had multiple sires. Such high levels of polyandry raise the possibility that polyandry evolved in viviparous sharks to reduce genetic incompatibilities between mother and embryos. We did not find a relationship between relatedness of mates and the number of offspring produced, indicating that inbreeding avoidance was probably not driving pre- or postcopulatory mate choice. Adult male sharks rarely sired more than one litter at Bimini and may mate over a broader geographic area.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are suffering severe depletion of apex predators worldwide [1-4]; shark declines are principally due to conservative life-histories and fisheries overexploitation [5-8]. On coral reefs, sharks are strongly interacting apex predators and play??a key role in maintaining healthy reef ecosystems [9-11]. Despite increasing fishing pressure, reef shark catches are rarely subject to specific limits, with management approaches typically depending upon no-take marine reserves to maintain populations [12-14]. Here, we reveal that this approach is failing by documenting an ongoing collapse in two of the most abundant reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). We find an order of magnitude fewer sharks on fished reefs compared to no-entry management zones that encompass only 1{\%} of reefs. No-take zones, which are more difficult to enforce than no-entry zones, offer almost no protection for shark populations. Population viability models of whitetip and gray reef sharks project ongoing steep declines in abundance of 7{\%} and 17{\%} per annum, respectively. These findings indicate that current management of no-take areas is inadequate for protecting reef sharks, even in one of the world's most-well-managed reef ecosystems. Further steps are urgently required for protecting this critical functional group from ecological extinction. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) that exclude fishing have been shown repeatedly to enhance the abundance, size, and diversity of species. These benefits, however, mean little to most marine species, because individual protected areas typically are small. To meet the larger-scale conservation challenges facing ocean ecosystems, several nations are expanding the benefits of individual protected areas by building networks of protected areas. Doing so successfully requires a detailed understanding of the ecological and physical characteristics of ocean ecosystems and the responses of humans to spatial closures. There has been enormous scientific interest in these topics, and frameworks for the design of MPA networks for meeting conservation and fishery management goals are emerging. Persistent in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between achieving conservation and fishery goals. Through a synthetic analysis across these conservation and bioeconomic studies, we construct guidelines for MPA network design that reduce or eliminate this tradeoff. We present size, spacing, location, and configuration guidelines for designing networks that simultaneously can enhance biological conservation and reduce fishery costs or even increase fishery yields and profits. Indeed, in some settings, a well-designed MPA network is critical to the optimal harvest strategy. When reserves benefit fisheries, the optimal area in reserves is moderately large (mode ≈30{\%}). Assessing network design principals is limited currently by the absence of empirical data from large-scale networks. Emerging networks will soon rectify this constraint.},

Of the 143 externally tagged juvenile sharks ({\textless} 110 cm), 22 (15.3{\%}) were recaptured between 0 and 5 km from the site of tagging after 5-800 days at liberty, suggesting some site-fidelity in young individuals of this species. Site-fidelity and movement patterns of ten juvenile sharks ranging from 78 to 110 cm total length (TL) and one opportunistically captured adult female (224 cm TL) were also investigated for periods of up to 2 years with an array of automated telemetry receivers. Tagging and telemetry data from both inside and outside a marine protected area (MPA) show that shark abundance and activity is greatest along the part of the archipelago's coastline least disturbed by human activity. Telemetry tracking also showed that juvenile reef sharks demonstrated a high degree of site-fidelity and occupied specific locations along the coast throughout the year, with some evidence of an increase in activity space with ontogeny. Sharks appeared to range more widely at night and there were no seasonal variations in habitat use. Our results suggest that MPAs may be a useful conservation tool to protect young C. perezi and potentially other reef-dwelling carcharhinid sharks during their early life history.},

abstract = {Many species of detritivorous invertebrates in small streams depend almost entirely on inputs of leaf litter for their nutritional requirements, however the concentration of this resource varies considerably seasonally. An experiment designed to test the hypothesis that productivity of coarse particle detritus feeders (shredders) is seasonally food limited was performed using replicate streamside channels that received one of three input rates of whole leaf detritus (rates equal to those naturally falling into montane streams, and two levels of increased inputs). Seven of the nine common shredder species attained significantly higher adult mass, higher densities, or both when food was supplemented. Larval densities of Malenka spp. and Brillia retifinis were significantly higher when additional food was added. Brillia retifinis densities were more than 10 x greater in high food additions than in the "natural" treatment; B. retifinis apparently fills a role as a fugitive in this system and is better able to track shifts in resource abundance by virtue of its short generation time. Zapada cinctipes and Z. haysi were more dense in high and intermediate food input treatments during the last half of the summer. Other taxa had nonsignificant trends to higher densities when extra food was provided. Most of the change in benthic densities can be attributed to decreased rates of emigration with increased food supply. Six of the eight taxa for which adult mass at emergence was measured were significantly more massive (4-46{\%}) when food was added. Both sexes exhibited this increase in mass, but females gained proportionally more in most species. There were no detectable changes in the timing of adult emergence due to food manipulations. The biomass of most taxa increased in proportion to the overall increase in biomass of the common coarse-detritus consumers. The main exceptions to that pattern were a disproportionate increase in the percentage of the biomass represented by Brillia retifinis and a decrease in the representation of Zapada cinctipes. The responses of this community to food supplementation demonstrate food limitation of detritivores. The exponential increase in benthic biomass under food addition shows the scope for productivity if food were not limiting. These coexisting species benefitted from enhanced food supply on a spatial scale that is relevant for population level processes. The large seasonal variation in resource abundance under natural conditions creates bottlenecks during periods of low food supply, which constrain subsequent production even during periods when food is abundant},

In many regions, bycatch of imperiled species is one of a number of issues that threatens species viability and impedes the development of sustainable fisheries. Effectively addressing bycatch of species of conservation concern and improving fisheries sustainability require cross-sectoral integration of information on the biological, socioeconomic, and political contexts of each fishery. Several gaps present simultaneous challenges, including: limited engagement with fisher communities, a lack of data, a need for more robust analyses of available data, and a need for coordinated governance from local to global scales. Here we present a framework to address fisheries bycatch that builds on established methods in community collaboration and engagement, field-based interviews, quantitative bycatch analyses, and ocean policy governance. Although these individual approaches to reduce bycatch are well established, there has yet to be a comprehensive application of an integrated approach. We review these essential approaches and present a broadly applicable model for their integration.},

However , for many species , we do not have a good understanding of the range of GC concentrations that might indicate a compromised individual . A temporary increase in GC concentration can prompt the adoption of behavior or activities to promote individual survival . However , chronic GC elevation results in deleterious effects on health that can reduce survival . In order to use GC concentration as a metric of individual fitness for a given species , it will be necessary to relate individual demographic rates to GC concentration . We related survival in American pikas (Ochotona princeps) to 2 different stress metrics , glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) concentration in fecal samples and GC concentration in plasma samples . Annual survival was analyzed in relation to each of these stress metrics as well as other physiological metrics and habitat characteristics at several sites in the Rocky Mountains . Among the predictors considered , GCM concentration was by far the strongest predictor of annual survival in pikas , and individuals with higher baseline GCM were less likely to survive . Our metric of flea load was also negatively related to annual survival . Given the limited time and resources that characterize many wildlife conservation projects , it is important to establish which endocrine metrics are the most informative for a species . American pikas have been identified as a sentinel species for detecting effects of climate change , and several correlational studies have projected range contraction for the species . Our results suggest that more mechanistic projections might be possible given further study of the relationship between GCM and climate .

Totoaba (Totoaba macdonaldii) and the vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) are two priority species in the national and international agendas for marine protection. We observe that while the measures taken by the State, since 1949, show a growing commitment to sustainable management of the region, there are limitations in the design and implementation of concrete actions for their protection. Some possible reasons the tools have proven to be ineffective are: there has been no consistency between the goals of fisheries and conservation sectors; the decrees are not clear on how they will achieve success; the fishers have not been sufficiently or appropriately informed about the harm done by their work practices and they only respond to their needs and interests; there is not enough honest inspection and surveillance, so illegal and improper practices occur. The case of totoaba has been handled in a way that is clearly ineffective, because the instruments have focused on the protection of adults without regard to juveniles. This is possibly because the decrees have tried not to interfere with shrimp fishing at sea.},

abstract = {Decadal-scale observations of marine reserves suggest that indirect effects on taxa that occur through cascading trophic interactions take longer to develop than direct effects on target species. Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species (+/-SE) was 5.13 +/- 1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13.1 +/- 2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2 +/- 1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1 +/- 1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the ecological consequences of individual trait variation within populations. Given that individual variability arises from evolutionary dynamics, to fully understand eco-evolutionary feedback loops, we need to pay special attention to how standing trait variability affects ecological dynamics. There is mounting empirical evidence that intra-specific phenotypic variation can exceed species-level means, but theoretical models of multi-trophic species coexistence typically neglect individual-level trait variability. What is needed are multispecies datasets that are resolved at the individual level that can be used to discriminate among alternative models of resource selection and species coexistence in food webs. Here, using one the largest individual-based datasets of a food web compiled to date, along with an individual trait-based stochastic model that incorporates Approximate Bayesian computation methods, we document intra-population variation in the strength of prey selection by different classes or predator phenotypes which could potentially alter the diversity and coexistence patterns of food webs. In particular, we found that strongly connected individual predators preferentially consumed common prey, whereas weakly connected predators preferentially selected rare prey. Such patterns suggest that food web diversity may be governed by the distribution of predator connectivity and individual trait variation in prey selection. We discuss the consequences of intra-specific variation in prey selection to assess fitness differences among predator classes (or phenotypes) and track longer term food web patterns of coexistence accounting for several phenotypes within each prey and predator species. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We review literature concerning the impacts of climate change on the migration of marine species, with an emphasis on the adaptation of migration phenology through genetic tracking and phenotypic plasticity. We then develop an individual-based modeling framework characterizing the effects of climate change on phenology and population dynamics. In the framework, an animal's ability to match its environmental preferences, its bioclimate envelope, to the environmental conditions by adjusting its migration timing between foraging and breeding habitats determines its condition, survival, and fecundity. Climate-induced changes in the envelope produce timing mismatches that result in a population adapting its phenology through both genetic and plastic processes. Model results suggest: (1) the temporal size of the bioclimate envelope is an important determinant of a population's sensitivity to climate change and susceptibility to extinction, (2) population extinction can occur if the rate of change in the timing of the envelope exceeds the rate its phenology changes or if the variability in the envelope exceeds the population's inherent capacity for variability, (3) a population with migration timing cued by photoperiod is expected to exhibit weaker phenotypic plasticity than one cued by temperature, and (4) population extinction in response to climate change follows a threshold pattern such that population size may not be a reliable indicator of extinction threat, although variability in average individual condition across years may be an extinction threat indicator. Finally, while the model is intentionally simplistic, we discuss how it can be extended to cover more complex interactions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Mathematical methods: A structured, semi-discrete, mechanistic metapopulation model in which patch age is the structuring variable. We apply adaptive dynamics for the evolutionary analysis and derive an invasion fitness proxy for this model setting. Key assumptions: Global climate change potentially alters the probability of patch extinction, dispersal costs, mortality, and fecundity. Births and immigration occur at discrete points in time. Deaths and emigration occur continuously over time. We model `average' patch dynamics. Results: Potentially viable metapopulations nevertheless can be destined for extinction via evolutionary suicide driven by climatic forcing. Specifically, selection can drive down dispersal rates in viable metapopulations, degrading colonization rates and increasing extinction rates to the point where the metapopulation crashes. Conclusions: Exclusive reliance on ecological dynamics without this evolutionary perspective would miss the phenomenon identified here. This result arises in realistic ranges of parameters and therefore generates a testable hypothesis with potential applications to long-term metapopulation sustainability.},

After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference.

We focus on two estimators of relative abundance, which assume that the probability that an individual is detected at least once in the survey is either equal or unequal for the two populations. We present three methods for incorporating the collected information into our inference. The first method, proposed previously, is a traditional hypothesis test for evidence that detection probabilities are unequal. However, we feel that, a priori, it is more likely that detection probabilities are actually different; hence, the burden of proof should be shifted, requiring evidence that detection probabilities are practically equivalent. The second method we present, equivalence testing, is one approach to doing so. Third, we suggest that model averaging could be used by combining the two estimators according to derived model weights. These differing approaches are applied to a mark--recapture experiment on Nuttall's cottontail rabbit ($\backslash$emph{\{}Sylvilagus nuttallii{\}}) conducted in central Oregon during 1974 and 1975, which has been previously analyzed by other authors.},

This paper (i) discusses the neuroendocrine pathways via which foraging conditions and predictive cues such as photoperiod enforce seasonality, (ii) considers the kinds of seasonal challenges mammals actually face in natural habitats, and (iii) uses the information thus generated to suggest how seasonal reproduction might be influenced by global climate change. Food availability and ambient temperature determine energy balance, and variation in energy balance is the ultimate cause of seasonal breeding in all mammals and the proximate cause in many. Photoperiodic cueing is common among long-lived mammals from the highest latitudes down to the mid-tropics. It is much less common in shorter lived mammals at all latitudes. An unknown predictive cue triggers reproduction in some desert and dry grassland species when it rains. The available information suggests that as our climate changes the small rodents of the world may adapt rather easily but the longer lived mammals whose reproduction is regulated by photoperiod may not do so well.

abstract = {Abstract. Changes in human behavior are a precursor to measurable impacts of no-take marine reserves. We investigated changes in recreational fishing site selection in response to the 2005 announcement of enforcement in a marine reserve in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We used a novel data set of daily self-reported boating destinations from emergency rescue logbooks for a recreational angling community from 2000 to 2008. Because the reserve system has no experimental control, we modeled the data two ways to test for robustness to model specification. We tested for changes in human fishing behavior with regression and fit a fleet- level discrete choice model to project a counterfactual scenario. The counterfactual is the statistically constructed ex post expectation of the human behavior we would have observed if the reserve never existed. We included month and year fixed effects in our models to account for seasonal and interannual fluctuations in fishing behavior and catch rates. We detected a decrease in reserve use compared to the counterfactual, indicating that the reserve rapidly experienced a decrease in visitation. However, the reserve's effect to reduce trips diminished with time. These results indicate that the reserve is unlikely to meet its ecological goals without institutional changes that enhance compliance. This illustrates the value of human use data to understanding the processes underlying marine reserve function. We suggest that managers should consider human use with the same frequency, rigor, and tools as they do fishery stocks.

They are a paradigm for testing evolutionary hypotheses about traits favoured by particular environmental factors. This paper is an attempt to summarize the conceptual framework for local adaptation studies. We first review theoretical work relevant for local adaptation. Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme x habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation - divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

abstract = {The level of genetic variation in natural populations influences evolutionary potential, and may therefore influence responses to selection in the face of future environmental changes. By combining long-term monitoring of marked individuals with genetic pedigree reconstruction, we assessed whether habitat loss influenced genetic variation in a lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) pop- ulation at an isolated nursery lagoon (Bimini, Bahamas). We also tracked changes in the strength and direction of natural selection. Contrary to initial expectations, we found that after the habitat loss neutral genetic variation increased, as did additive genetic variance for juvenile morphological traits (body length and mass). We hypothesize that these effects might result from philopatric behavior in females coupled with a possible influx of male geno- types from other nursery sites. We also found changes in the strength of selec- tion on morphological traits, which weakened considerably after the disturbance; habitat loss therefore changed the phenotypes favored by natural selection. Because such human-induced shifts in the adaptive landscape may be common, we suggest that conservation biologists should not simply focus on neutral genetic variation per se, but also on assessing and preserving evolution- ary parameters, such as additive genetic variation and selection.},

abstract = {Inputs of energy and nutrients from one ecosystem may subsidize consumers in adjacent ones, with significant consequences for local communities and food webs. We used stable isotope and faecal pellet analysis to quantify use of ocean-derived resources by small mammals on islands in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Rodents were live-trapped on grids originating near shore and extending 125-200 m inland to evaluate the extent to which rodents transport marine nutrients inland, and to determine whether marine foods subsidize island populations, permitting higher densities than would be possible based on terrestrial resources alone. Both faeces and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes revealed that omnivorous mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) consume ocean-derived prey, including littoral and supralittoral invertebrates, and that their diets differed markedly from those of granivorous rodents (Chaetodipus rudinoris). On a small, seabird roosting island, marine prey were important in the diet of mice regardless of their proximity to shore, underscoring the pervasive influence of the ocean on small islands with relatively large coastline area. On a large island, however, consumption of marine foods declined sharply {\textgreater} or =50 m from shore, which suggests that mice are poor conduits of inland movement of energy and nutrients from the sea. Marine resources seemed to act as subsidies for omnivorous rodents: more P. maniculatus were captured near shore than farther inland and there was an inverse relationship between island area and rodent abundance, suggesting that small islands with large amounts of marine inputs support the highest population densities. Patterns of local and island-wide abundance of P. maniculatus are likely the result of several interacting factors, including frustrated dispersal, competition with C. rudinoris, and the absence of predators. We speculate, however, that the availability of marine resources allows P. maniculatus to reach high densities and to persist on small islands in the Gulf despite low and unpredictable terrestrial productivity. Spatial trophic subsidies thus provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the widely reported inverse relationship between population density and island or habitat area.},

abstract = {Flows of energy and materials link ecosystems worldwide and have important consequences for the structure of ecological communities. While these resource subsidies typically enter recipient food webs through multiple channels, most previous studies focussed on a single pathway of resource input. We used path analysis to evaluate multiple pathways connecting chronic marine resource inputs (in the form of seaweed deposits) and herbivory in a shoreline terrestrial ecosystem. We found statistical support for a fertilization effect (seaweed increased foliar nitrogen content, leading to greater herbivory) and a lizard numerical response effect (seaweed increased lizard densities, leading to reduced herbivory), but not for a lizard diet-shift effect (seaweed increased the proportion of marine-derived prey in lizard diets, but lizard diet was not strongly associated with herbivory). Greater seaweed abundance was associated with greater herbivory, and the fertilization effect was larger than the combined lizard effects. Thus, the bottom-up, plant-mediated effect of fertilization on herbivory overshadowed the top-down effects of lizard predators. These results, from unmanipulated shoreline plots with persistent differences in chronic seaweed deposition, differ from those of a previous experimental study of the short-term effects of a pulse of seaweed deposition: while the increase in herbivory in response to chronic seaweed deposition was due to the fertilization effect, the short-term increase in herbivory in response to a pulse of seaweed deposition was due to the lizard diet-shift effect. This contrast highlights the importance of the temporal pattern of resource inputs in determining the mechanism of community response to resource subsidies.},

abstract = {Species richness has dominated our view of global biodiversity patterns for centuries. The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological basis for management. However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling). Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning 133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community (calculated using Rao's Q), and differ from previously reported patterns in functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize species-rich tropical regions only. There is a global trend for greater evenness in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with well-known latitudinal gradients in richness. Our findings suggest that the contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when tracking changes to biodiversity values.},

We use game theory to model phenological adaptation in migratory birds that compete for territories at their breeding grounds. We investigate how the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the timing of arrival is affected by changes in the onset of spring, the timing of the resource peak, and the season length. We compare the ESS mean arrival date with the environmental optimum, that is, the mean arrival date that maximizes fitness in the absence of competition. When competition is strong, the ESS mean arrival date responds less than the environmental optimum to shifts in the resource peak but more to changes in the onset of spring. Increased season length may not necessarily affect the environmental optimum but can still advance the ESS mean arrival date. Conversely, shifting a narrow resource distribution may change the environmental optimum without affecting the ESS mean arrival date. The ESS mean arrival date and the environmental optimum may even shift in different directions. Hence, treating phenology as an evolutionary game rather than an optimization problem fundamentally changes what we predict to be an adaptive response to environmental changes.},

We map proxies of chronic and acute thermal stress and develop evidence-based hypotheses for the future response of corals to each stress regime. We then incorporate spatially realistic predictions of larval connectivity among reefs of the Bahamas and apply novel reserve design algorithms to create reserve networks for a changing climate. We show that scales of larval dispersal are large enough to connect reefs from desirable thermal stress regimes into a reserve network. Critically, we find that reserve designs differ according to the anticipated scope for phenotypic and genetic adaptation in corals, which remains uncertain.

abstract = {Ecologists have a long tradition of studying how species interact. Almost all of this work, however, has focused on networks involved in a single type of interaction. For instance, ecologists have studied either "antagonistic" interactions, such as those in who-eats-who food webs, or, more recently, mutually beneficial interactions, such as those between flowering plants and their insect pollinators. Very few studies have embraced both (13), leaving a key question: To what degree do different kinds of interactions lead to ecological networks with different structures? The answer is crucial to understanding the suite of ecological, evolutionary, and coevolutionary processes that shape these networks and how they may respond to future changes. On page 853 of this issue, Th bault and Fontaine (4) take an important step forward by comparing the structure and dynamics of antagonistic and mutualistic networks.},

abstract = {We compare and contrast the design of networks of marine reserves for two different, commonly stated goals: (1) maintaining high yield in fisheries and (2) conserving biodiversity, in an idealized setting using simple models. The models describe larval dispersal over a system of evenly spaced reserves of equal size, assuming sedentary adults. We initially demonstrate that, since populations in reserve systems can be sustained either by covering a minimal fraction of the coast with small reserves or by covering a smaller fraction of the coast with few large reserves, cost considerations dictate that the conservation goal would be best met by reserves as large as practically possible. In contrast, the fisheries goal of maximizing yield requires maximizing larval export outside of reserves, which we show means that reserves should be as small as practically possible. Meeting the fisheries goal is ultimately more costly because it suggests a larger area of the coastline should be in reserves, but it also improves on conservation goals by enhancing sustainability for species dispersing longer distances.},

abstract = {The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological effects of climate change is whether species will be able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their changing environment. If we establish the maximal rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to the rate at which temperatures can increase without loss of biodiversity.The rate of adaptation will primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii) learning will be favourable to the individual but cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii) maternal effects may play a role but, as with other forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv) adaptation via immigration of individuals with genotypes adapted to warmer environments also involves microevolution as these genotypes are better adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of, for instance, photoperiod.Long-term studies on wild populations with individually known animals play an essential role in detecting and understanding the temporal trends in life-history traits, and to estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures on, life-history traits. However, additional measurements on other trophic levels and on the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are needed to predict the rate of microevolution, especially under changing conditions.Using this knowledge on heritability of, and selection on, life-history traits, in combination with climate scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to make the link to population viability and from there to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the rate of adaptation is insufficient. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

Incor- porating speciation into the theory of island biogeography unexpectedly results in unification of these two theories. The unified theory predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity number ? that controls not only species rich- ness, but also relative species abundance in the source area metacommunity at equilibrium between speciation and extinction. With additional parameters for island size and migration rate, the theory also predicts relative species abundance on islands or local regions of continuous land- scapes. Application of the theory to the biogeography and biodiversity of communities of tropical trees and reef- building corals are discussed. One important result is that only relatively modest migration rates are sufficient to dynamically couple the regional metacommunity and sta- bilize community structure on large spatiotemporal scales. Thus, regional, long-term compositional stasis in tropical rain forests and coral reefs can arise just as easily from the stabilizing effect of large numbers as from niche- assembly rules that limit species membership in communi- ties. Because of the higher intrinsic vagility of corals, the theory predicts greater regional similarity in coral reef communities than in tropical tree communities},

We conclude that extreme climatic events are key drivers of biodiversity patterns and that the frequency and intensity of such episodes have major implications for predictive models of species distribution and ecosystem structure, which are largely based on gradual warming trends.},

abstract = {The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of 'critical slowing down' that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down, (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system; bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others, and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise.},

Grazing history, which was defined by the location of plants located either {\textless} 2 m or {\textgreater} 6 m from boulderfields with a history of occupation by pikas, was the most significant factor determining shifts in leaf births and leaf deaths following herbivory. 3The only detectable influence of current season herbivory for any measured species was a reduction of leaf length of Kobresia. 4A comparison of historically grazed with historically ungrazed plants indicated several changes in leaf demography and morphology. Kobresia leaves were generally shorter and had higher rates of production of new leaves. Oxytropis had higher rates of new leaf production. Erigeron had fewer leaf births throughout the summer, but showed a large and highly significant delay in the timing of leaf senescence. 5These responses can be largely understood as strategies to avoid the predictable intensive late season foraging that is characteristic of pikas.

abstract = {Abstract. Conservation practitioners use demographic population viability analysis (PVA) to understand long-term effects of changing demographic rates on population growth rate. Sensitivities and elasticities of stage-specific survival and fertility rates provide managers with guidelines on the relative contributions of various life-history stages to long-term population growth. However, short-term patterns, especially single-year effects, of elasticity may be dramatically different from long-term effects, calling for caution in implementing management policies focusing entirely on only long- or short-term elasticities. Here we illustrate the temporal and spatial variation in elasticity patterns for four populations of California sea lions. Short-term stochastic elasticities were significantly different from long- term elasticities, and spatial patterns of short- and long-term elasticities varied across sites. These differences may be explained by transient effects in age structure and deviations from the stable age distribution, as well as environmental variation. Our results suggest that conservation practitioners should consider calculations of both short-and long-term elasticity in viability analyses that are used to guide management and should use caution in generalizing elasticity patterns across populations.},

Reserves have recently received enormous attention as a means of better conserving harvested resources, despite limited empirical evidence of their efficacy. We used manipulated microcosms to test whether reserves reduce extinction risk in mobile populations of harvested Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliate. Here we show that patterns of population distribution inside and outside reserves can be accurately predicted on the basis of simple models of diffusion coupled with logistic controls on local population growth. No extinctions occurred in eight experimental trials with reserves, whereas extinction occurred in seven of eight trials without reserves, as predicted by population viability models based on stochastic population processes. These results suggest that marine reserves may be an effective means of improving long-term viability in heavily harvested fish species.},

abstract = {Many natural systems are subject to seasonal environmental change. As a consequence many species exhibit seasonal changes in their life history parameters--such as a peak in the birth rate in spring. It is important to understand how this seasonal forcing affects the population dynamics. The main way in which seasonal models have been studied is through a two dimensional bifurcation approach. We augment this bifurcation approach with extensive simulation in order to understand the potential solution behaviours for a predator-prey system with a seasonally forced prey growth rate. We consider separately how forcing influences the system when the unforced dynamics have either monotonic decay to the coexistence steady state, or oscillatory decay, or stable limit cycles. The range of behaviour the system can exhibit includes multi-year cycles of different periodicities, parameter ranges with coexisting multi-year cycles of the same or different period as well as quasi-periodicity and chaos. We show that the level of oscillation in the unforced system has a large effect on the range of behaviour when the system is seasonally forced. We discuss how the methods could be extended to understand the dynamics of a wide range of ecological and epidemiological systems that are subject to seasonal changes.},

Logbook data collected 2004-2008 from two Oahu (Hawaii) shark cage diving operations were analysed to determine whether such voluntary records provide useful insights into shark ecology or ecotourism impacts. Operators correctly identified common shark species and documented gross seasonal cycles and long-term trends in abundance of Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and tiger sharks (Galeorcerdo cuvier). Annual cycles in shark abundance may indicate seasonal migrations, whereas long-term trends suggest gradual exclusion of smaller sandbar sharks from cage diving sites. Numerically dominant ({\textgreater} 98{\%}) Galapagos and sandbar sharks are rarely implicated in attacks on humans. Negligible impact on public safety is supported by other factors such as: (1) remoteness of the sites, (2) conditioning stimuli that are specific to the tour operations and different from inshore recreational stimuli and (3) no increase in shark attacks on the north coast of Oahu since cage diving started. Tracking studies are required to validate logbook data and to determine whether sharks associated with offshore cage diving travel into inshore areas used for in-water recreation.},

abstract = {Accurate assessment of shark population status is essential for conservation but is often constrained by limited and unreliable data. To provide a basis for improved management of shark resources, we analyzed a long-term record of species-specific catches, sizes, and sexes of sharks collected by onboard observers in the western and central Pacific Ocean from 1995 to 2010. Using generalized linear models, we estimated population-status indicators on the basis of catch rate and biological indicators of fishing pressure on the basis of median size to identify trends for blue (Prionace glauca), mako (Isurus spp.), oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Standardized catch rates of longline fleets declined significantly for blue sharks in the North Pacific (by 5{\%} per year [CI 2{\%} to 8{\%}]), for mako sharks in the North Pacific (by 7{\%} per year [CI 3{\%} to 11{\%}]), and for oceanic whitetip sharks in tropical waters (by 17{\%} per year [CI 14{\%} to 20{\%}]). Median lengths of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks decreased significantly in their core habitat, and almost all sampled silky sharks were immature. Our results are consistent with results of analyses of similar data sets. Combined, these results and evidence of targeted fishing for sharks in some regional fisheries heighten concerns for sustainable utilization, particularly for oceanic whitetip and North Pacific blue sharks. Regional regulations that prohibit shark finning (removal of fins and discarding of the carcass) were enacted in 2007 and are in many cases the only form of control on shark catches. However, there is little evidence of a reduction of finning in longline fisheries. In addition, silky and oceanic whitetip sharks are more frequently retained than finned, which suggests that even full implementation of and adherence to a finning prohibition may not substantially reduce mortality rates for these species. We argue that finning prohibitions divert attention from assessing whether catch levels are sustainable and that the need for management of sharks should not be addressed by measures that are simple to implement but complex to enforce and evaluate.},

Classical approaches to the study of phenology have typically documented changes in the timing of single life-history events, while phenological shifts affect many interactions over entire life histories. In this study, we suggest an approach that integrates the phenology and ontogeny of species interactions with a fitness landscape to provide a common mechanistic framework for investigating phenological shifts. We suggest that this ontogeny-phenology landscape provides a flexible method to document changes in the relative phenologies of interacting species, examine the causes of these phenological shifts, and estimate their consequences for interacting species.},

abstract = {To understand how organisms adapt to novel habitats, which involves both demographic and selective events, we require knowledge of the evolutionary history of populations and also selected alleles. There are still few cases in which the precise mutations (and hence, defined alleles) that contribute to adaptive change have been identified in nature; one exception is the genetic basis of camouflaging pigmentation of oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus) that have colonized the sandy dunes of Florida's Gulf Coast. To quantify the genomic impact of colonization as well as the signature of selection, we resequenced 5000 1.5-kb noncoding loci as well as a 160-kb genomic region surrounding the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r), a gene that contributes to pigmentation differences, in beach and mainland populations. Using a genome-wide phylogenetic approach, we recovered a single monophyletic group comprised of beach mice, consistent with a single colonization event of the Gulf Coast. We also found evidence of a severe founder event, estimated to have occurred less than 3000 years ago. In this demographic context, we show that all beach subspecies share a single derived light Mc1r allele, which was likely selected from standing genetic variation that originated in the mainland. Surprisingly, we were unable to identify a clear signature of selection in the Mc1r region, despite independent evidence that this locus contributes to adaptive coloration. Nonetheless, these data allow us to reconstruct and compare the evolutionary history of populations and alleles to better understand how adaptive evolution, following the colonization of a novel habitat, proceeds in nature.},

After a adaptive event, selection (becuase of drift?) and demography play a large role
-need to seperate the two

        

        
Science
When organisms colonize new habitats both demographic and selection events will take place. However, it can be very difficult to seperate the two processes. Here, the authors reconstruct both the evolutionary history of populations of mice and alleles that have been selected in the population. They specifically investigated camoflauge pigmenetation as the genetic basis for this phenotype is known. They sequenced mice from both mainland (presumbly ancestral) and a recently conlinized island population. They found that mice colonized the island less than 3000 years ago and that a single recolonization event took place. I felt it was a great use of the technology to address meaningful evolutionary questions. 

        
Technology
 The authors collected mice tissue samples at 13 locations including both mainland and island populations. Using a Autogen kit, they collected genomic data from each tissue sample. This data was processed with Illumina technology and collected 1.5kb reads at random locations in the genome. This generated 601 million paired-end reads with a high level that could be correctly assigned. This data was then used to estimate genetic diversity, differentiaion, and the demography of the colonized beach sites. },

abstract = {Marine reserves are promoted as an effective supplement to traditional fishery management techniques of harvest quotas and effort limitation. However, quantitative fishery models have ignored the impact of noncompliance (poaching). Here we link a model of a harvested fish population to a game-theoretic representation of fisherman behavior to quantify the effect of poaching on fishery yield and the enforcement effort required to maintain any desired level of reserve effectiveness. Although higher fish densities inside reserves will typically entice fishermen to poach, we show that the initial investment in enforcement efforts provides the greatest return on maintaining the benefits of the reserve to the fishery. Furthermore, we find that poaching eliminates the positive effect of fish dispersal on yield that is predicted by traditional models that ignore fisherman behavior. Our results broaden a fundamental insight from previous models of marine reserves, the effective equivalence of the harvest quota and reserve fraction, to the more realistic scenario in which fishermen attempt to maximize their economic payoffs.},

abstract = {SignificanceUnderstanding how social dynamics drive outcomes in environmental systems is critical to advancing global sustainability. We link comprehensive data on fishers information-sharing networks and observed fishing behaviors to demonstrate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact ecological health. Specifically, we find evidence that the propensity for individuals to share information primarily with others most similar to themselves creates segregated networks that impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors--behaviors that could have mitigated the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks in a single commercial fishery between 2008 and 2012. Our results suggest having a better understanding of social structures and bolstering effective communication across segregated networks has the potential to contribute toward more sustainable environmental outcomes. Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.},

These sand features and associated backwater habitats provide key wildlife habitat, protect archaeological sites, enhance riparian vegetation, and provide camping opportunities along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. This protocol for high-flow experimental releases from Glen Canyon Dam is part of the ongoing implementation of the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program.

abstract = {The primary nonbiological result of recent rapid climate change is warming winter temperatures, particularly at northern latitudes, leading to longer growing seasons and new seasonal exigencies and opportunities. Biological responses reflect selection due to the earlier arrival of spring, the later arrival of fall, or the increasing length of the growing season. Animals from rotifers to rodents use the high reliability of day length to time the seasonal transitions in their life histories that are crucial to fitness in temperate and polar environments: when to begin developing in the spring, when to reproduce, when to enter dormancy or when to migrate, thereby exploiting favourable temperatures and avoiding unfavourable temperatures. In documented cases of evolutionary (genetic) response to recent, rapid climate change, the role of day length (photoperiodism) ranges from causal to inhibitory; in no case has there been demonstrated a genetic shift in thermal optima or thermal tolerance. More effort should be made to explore the role of photoperiodism in genetic responses to climate change and to rule out the role of photoperiod in the timing of seasonal life histories before thermal adaptation is assumed to be the major evolutionary response to climate change.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The concept of elasmobranch species using nursery areas was introduced in the early 1900s and has been an accepted aspect of shark biology and behavior for several decades. Despite several descriptions of how shark species use nursery areas and what types of regions nurseries may be found in, no explicit definition of what constitutes a shark nursery area has been presented. Here we evaluate the assumptions of the current shark nursery paradigm in light of available data. Based on examination of these assumptions and available methods of quantifying and accurately describing shark nursery areas, a new more quantitative definition of shark nursery areas is proposed. This def- inition requires 3 criteria to be met for an area to be identified as a nursery: (1) sharks are more com- monly encountered in the area than other areas; (2) sharks have a tendency to remain or return for extended periods; and (3) the area or habitat is repeatedly used across years. These criteria make the definition of shark nursery areas more compatible with those for other aquatic species. The improved definition of this concept will provide more valuable information for fisheries managers and shark biologists.},

As a result, a number of international efforts have sought to improve management and prevent overexploitation, while helping to maintain biodiversity and a sustainable food supply.

We used a survey approach, validated with empirical data, and enquiries to over 13,000 fisheries experts (of which 1,188 responded) to assess the current effectiveness of fisheries management regimes worldwide; for each of those regimes, we also calculated the probable sustainability of reported catches to determine how management affects fisheries sustainability.

A comparison of fisheries management attributes with the sustainability of reported fisheries catches indicated that the conversion of scientific advice into policy, through a participatory and transparent process, is at the core of achieving fisheries sustainability, regardless of other attributes of the fisheries.

Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (,14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of ,250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef.

     MPAs are often used as a conservation strategy without knowledge on the spatial movement of species the MPA is supposed to protect. This paper is the first to provide information on shark movement in a proposed MPA (as opposed to an MPA already in place).

abstract = {There are now thousands of estimates of phenotypic selection in natural populations, resulting in multiple synthetic reviews of these data. Here we consider several major lessons and limitations emerging from these syntheses, and how they may guide future studies of selection in the wild. First, we review past analyses of the patterns of directional selection. We present new meta-analyses that confirm differences in the direction and magnitude of selection for different types of traits and fitness components. Second, we describe patterns of temporal and spatial variation in directional selection, and their implications for cumulative selection and directional evolution. Meta-analyses suggest that sampling error contributes importantly to observed temporal variation in selection, and indicate that evidence for frequent temporal changes in the direction of selection in natural populations is limited. Third, we review the apparent lack of evidence for widespread stabilizing selection, and discuss biological and methodological explanations for this pattern. Finally, we describe how sampling error, statistical biases, choice of traits, fitness measures and selection metrics, environmental covariance and other factors may limit the inferences we can draw from analyses of selection coefficients. Current standardized selection metrics based on simple parametric statistical models may be inadequate for understanding patterns of non-linear selection and complex fitness surfaces. We highlight three promising areas for expanding our understanding of selection in the wild: (1) field studies of stabilizing selection, selection on physiological and behavioral traits, and the ecological causes of selection; (2) new statistical models and methods that connect phenotypic variation to population demography and selection; and (3) availability of the underlying individual-level data sets from past and future selection studies, which will allow comprehensive modeling of selection and fitness variation within and across systems, rather than meta-analyses of standardized selection metrics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {I explored the effect of uncertainty in demographic traits on demographic analyses of sharks, an approach not used before for this taxon. I used age-structured life tables and Leslie matrices based on a pre- breeding survey and a yearly time step applied only to females to model the demography of 41 populations from 38 species of sharks representing four orders and nine families. I used Monte Carlo simulation to reflect uncertainty in the estimates of demographic traits and to calculate population statistics and elasticities for these populations; I used correlation analysis to identify the demographic traits that explained most of the variation in population growth rates (lambda). The populations I examined fell along a continuum of life-history characteristics that can be linked to elasticity patterns. Sharks characterized by early age at maturity, short lifespan, and large litter size had high lambda values and short generation times, whereas sharks that mature late and have long lifespans and small litters have low lambda values and long generation times. Sharks at the ``fast'' end of the spectrum tended to have comparable adult and juvenile survival elasticities, whereas sharks at the ``slow'' end of the continuum had high juvenile survival elasticity and low age--zero survival (or fertility) elasticity. Ratios of adult survival to fertility elasticities and juvenile survival to fertility elasticities suggest that many of the populations studied do not possess the biological attributes necessary to restore lambda to its original level after moderate levels of exploitation. Elasticity analysis suggests that changes in juvenile survival would have the greatest effect on lambda, and correlation analysis indicates that variation in juvenile survival, age at maturity, and reproduction account for most of the variation in lambda. In general, combined results from elasticity and correlation analyses suggest that research, conservation, and management efforts should focus on these demographic traits.},

Genes showing population-specific allele frequency changes, which represent strong candidates for altitude adaptation, were identified. The strongest signal of natural selection came from endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (EPAS1), a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia. One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at EPAS1 shows a 78{\%} frequency difference between Tibetan and Han samples, representing the fastest allele frequency change observed at any human gene to date. This SNP's association with erythrocyte abundance supports the role of EPAS1 in adaptation to hypoxia.

abstract = {The interplay between individual adaptive life histories and populations dynamics is an important issue in ecology. In this context, we considered a seasonal consumer-resource model with nonoverlapping generations. We focused on the consumers decision-making process through which they maximize their reproductive output via a differential investment into foraging for resources or reproducing. Our model takes a semi-discrete form, and is composed of a continuous time within-season part, similar to a dynamic model of energy allocation, and of a discrete time part, depicting the between seasons reproduction and mortality processes. We showed that the optimal foraging-reproduction strategies of the consumers may be "determinate" or "indeterminate" depending on the season length. More surprisingly, it depended on the consumers population density as well, with large densities promoting indeterminacy. A bifurcation analysis showed that the long-term dynamics produced by this model were quite rich, ranging from both populations' extinction, coexistence at some season-to-season equilibrium or on (quasi)-periodic motions, to initial condition-dependent dynamics. Interestingly, we observed that any long-term sustainable situation corresponds to indeterminate consumers' strategies. Finally, a comparison with a model involving typical nonoptimal consumers highlighted the stabilizing effects of the optimal life histories of the consumers.},

Summary:
This paper examines how a consumer can maximize reproductive output by putting more effort towards foraging or reproduction during a season. Using a semi-discrete mechanistic model of a consumer-resource system, they examine the optimal foraging strategy, {\$}u{\_}n(t){\$}, which is allowed to vary over the course of a season. Both consumers and resources are assumed to be annual species and mortality takes place at the end of each year. They then sent up an optimal control problem to determine the optimal foraging strategy of consumers. They study both within season and long term behavior of their model. Consumer density was important as low density selected for determinate strategies.},

abstract = {A defining hypothesis of theoretical ecology during the past century has been that population fluctuations might largely be explained by relatively low-dimensional, nonlinear ecological interactions, provided such interactions could be correctly identified and modeled. The realization in recent decades that such nonlinear interactions might result in chaos and other exotic dynamic behaviors has been exciting but tantalizing, in that attributing the fluctuations of a particular real population to the complex dynamics of a particular mathematical model has proved to be an elusive goal. We experimentally tested a model-predicted sequence of transitions (bifurcations) in the dynamic behavior of a population from stable equilibria to quasiperiodic and periodic cycles to chaos to three-cycles using cultures of the flour beetle Tribolium. The predictions arose from a system of difference equations (the LPA model) describing the nonlinear life-stage interactions, predominantly cannibalism. We built a stochastic version of the model incorporating demographic variability and obtained conditional least-squares estimates for the model parameters. We generated 2000 ``bootstrapped data sets'' with a time-series bootstrap technique, and for each set we reestimated the model parameters. The resulting 2000 bootstrapped parameter vectors were used to obtain confidence intervals for the model parameters and estimated distributions of the Liapunov exponents for the deterministic portion (the skeleton) of the model as well as for the full stochastic model. Frequency distributions of estimated dynamic behaviors of the skeleton at each experimental treatment were produced. For one treatment, over 83{\%} of the bootstrapped parameter estimates corresponded to chaotic attractors, and the remainder of the estimates yielded high-period cycles. The low-dimensional skeleton accounted for at least 90{\%} of the variability in the population abundances and accurately described the responses of populations to experimental demographic manipulations, including treatments for which the predicted dynamic behavior was chaos. Demographic stochasticity described the remaining noise quite well. We conclude that the fluctuations of experimental flour beetle populations are explained largely by known nonlinear forces involving cannibalistic-stage interactions. Claims of dynamic behavior such as periodic cycles or chaos must be accompanied by a consideration of the reliability of the estimated parameters and a realization that the population fluctuations are a blend of deterministic forces and stochastic events

We focus on the spring phenology of populations because it is highly responsive to climate change and easy to document across a wide range of species. We show that evolution can be fast and can occur at the time scale of a few decades. We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in current responses of ecological systems to climate change. Our conclusion is that evolution by natural selection is a pertinent force to consider even at the time scale of contemporary climate changes. However, all species may not be equal in their capacity to benefit from contemporary evolution.},

In 2008 the Mexican government announced a conservation action plan for this porpoise, with three options for a protected area closed to gill net fishing. The probability of success of each of the three options was estimated with a Bayesian population model, where success was defined as an increase in vaquita abundance after 10 yr. The model was fitted to data on abundance, bycatch, and fishing effort, although data were sparse and imprecise. Under the first protected area option, the existing Refuge Area for the Protection of the Vaquita, bycatch was about 7{\%} of population size, and probability of success was 0.08. Under the second option with a larger protected area, the probability of success was 0.35. The third option was large enough to eliminate vaquita bycatch and had a probability of success {\textgreater}0.99. Probability of success was reduced if elimination of vaquita bycatch was delayed or incomplete. Despite considerable efforts by the Mexican government to support vaquita conservation, abundance will probably continue to decline unless additional measures to reduce vaquita bycatch are taken, such as banning gill nets within the vaquita's range and developing effective alternative fishing gear.},

abstract = {Climate change has led to an advance in phenology in many species. Synchrony in phenology between different species within a food chain may be disrupted if an increase in temperature affects the phenology of the different species differently, as is the case in the winter moth egg hatch2013oak bud burst system. Operophtera brumata (winter moth) egg hatch date has advanced more than Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) bud burst date over the past two decades. Disrupted synchrony will lead to selection, and a response in phenology to this selection may lead to species genetically adapting to their changing environment. However, a prerequisite for such genetic change is that there is sufficient genetic variation and severe enough fitness consequences. So far, examples of observed genetic change have been few. Using a half-sib design, we demonstrate here that O. brumata egg-hatching reaction norm is heritable, and that genetic variation exists. Fitness consequences of even a few days difference between egg hatch and tree bud opening are severe, as we experimentally determined. Estimates of genetic variation and of fitness were then combined with a climate scenario to predict the rate and the amount of change in the eggs' response to temperature. We predict a rapid response to selection, leading to a restoration of synchrony of egg hatch with Q. robur bud opening. This study shows that in this case there is a clear potential to adapt 2013 rapidly 2013 to environmental change. The current observed asynchrony is therefore not due to a lack of genetic variation and at present it is unclear what is constraining O. brumata to adapt. This kind of model may be particularly useful in gaining insight in the predicted amount and rate of change due to environmental changes, given a certain genetic variation and selection pressure.},

To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5–2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1–14.8 days earlier on average).},

abstract = {A latitudinal gradient in biodiversity has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs, yet how and why this gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

abstract = {We present and evaluate an approach to analyzing population dynamics data using semimechanistic models. These models incorporate reliable information on population structure and underlying dynamic mechanisms but use nonparametric surface-fitting methods to avoid unsupported assumptions about the precise form of rate equations. Using historical data on measles epidemics as a case study, we show how this approach can lead to better forecasts, better characterizations of the dynamics, and a better understanding of the factors causing complex population dynamics relative to either mechanistic models or purely descriptive statistical time-series models. The semimechanistic models are found to have better forecasting accuracy than either of the model types used in previous analyses when tested on data not used to fit the models. The dynamics are characterized as being both nonlinear and noisy, and the global dynamics are clustered very tightly near the border of stability (dominant Lyapunov exponent lambda approximately 0). However, locally in state space the dynamics oscillate between strong short-term stability and strong short-term chaos (i.e., between negative and positive local Lyapunov exponents). There is statistically significant evidence for short-term chaos in all data sets examined. Thus the nonlinearity in these systems is characterized by the variance over state space in local measures of chaos versus stability rather than a single summary measure of the overall dynamics as either chaotic or nonchaotic.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of how mechanistic knowledge of organism-environment interactions, including biomechanical interactions of heat, mass and momentum transfer, can be integrated into basic theoretical population biology through mechanistic functional responses that quantitatively describe how organisms respond to their physical environment. Integrating such functional responses into simple community and microevolutionary models allows scaling up of the organism-level understanding from biomechanics both ecologically and temporally. For community models, Holling-type functional responses for predator-prey interactions provide a classic example of the functional response affecting qualitative model dynamics, and recent efforts are expanding analogous models to incorporate environmental influences such as temperature. For evolutionary models, mechanistic functional responses dependent on the environment can serve as fitness functions in both quantitative genetic and game theoretic frameworks, especially those concerning function-valued traits. I present a novel comparison of a mechanistic fitness function based on thermal performance curves to a commonly used generic fitness function, which quantitatively differ in their predictions for response to environmental change. A variety of examples illustrate how mechanistic functional responses enhance model connections to biologically relevant traits and processes as well as environmental conditions and therefore have the potential to link theoretical and empirical studies. Sensitivity analysis of such models can provide biologically relevant insight into which parameters and processes are important to community and evolutionary responses to environmental change such as climate change, which can inform conservation management aimed at protecting response capacity. Overall, the distillation of detailed knowledge or organism-environment interactions into mechanistic functional responses in simple population biology models provides a framework for integrating biomechanics and ecology that allows both tractability and generality.},

We assessed the impacts of SSWD over 5 of the 6 basins of the transboundary US/Canadian marine ecosystem, the Salish Sea, a world-wide hotspot for temperate asteroid species diversity with a high degree of endemism. We also studied SSWD on Washington's outer coast. We analyzed data on the three most common sea star species collected by trained volunteer scuba divers, before (2006-2013) and after (2014-2015) the SSWD outbreak, as well as scientific strip transect data for 8 common asteroid species and one genus collected by scientific divers in the San Juan islands during summer 2014 and 2015. In all 5 basins and on Washington's outer coast the sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), the dominant species, and the giant pink sea star (Pisaster brevispinus) showed severe declines, while the leather sea star (Dermasterias imbricata) did not. Strip transect data showed increasing SSWD prevalence in P. helianthoides, mottled star (Evasterias troschelii) and Henricia sp. between May and August 2014, although the maximum prevalences varied among species. Transect counts showed severe decline of adult P. helianthoides and moderate declines of E. troschelii and Henricia sp. Rare subtidal species such as purple sea star (Pisaster ochraceus), P. brevispinus, sun star (Solaster stimpsoni) and rainbow star (Orthasterias koehleri) also seem to have declined, while counts of D. imbricata and Vermilion star (Mediaster aequalis) suggested increasing densities. Our findings are consistent with previous reports on severe P. helianthoides reductions from California to Alaska, which rises concern with respect to the conservation of this ecologically important species. These data also highlight differential susceptibility and impact of SSWD among asteroid species.},

Incorrectly classifying whether a population is declining or not can lead to inappropriate conservation actions or management measures, with potentially profound societal costs. Here we evaluate key causes of misclassification of decline status and assess the reliability of 20 decline metrics using a stochastic model to simulate time series of population abundance of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We show that between-year variability in population productivity (process variation) and, to a lesser extent, variability in abundance estimates (observation error) are important causes of unreliable identification of population status. We found that using all available data, rather than just the most recent three generations, consistently improved the reliability of risk assessments. The approach outlined here can improve understanding of the reliability of risk assessments, thereby reducing concerns that may impede their use for exploited taxa such as marine fishes.

We first generated analytical predictions of the effects of altered seasonality on species persistence and the timing of community state transitions. We then parameterized the model using a zooplankton-phytoplankton system and tested quantitative predictions using controlled experiments. In the majority of cases, timing of zooplankton and algal population peaks matched model predictions. Decreases in growing-period length delayed algal blooms, consequently delaying peaks in zooplankton abundance. Predictions of increased probability of predator extinction at low growing-period lengths were also upheld experimentally. Our results highlight the utility of the SSD modeling approach as a framework for predicting the effects of altered seasonality on the structure and dynamics of multitrophic communities.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The American pika (Ochotona princeps) inhabits talus slopes on isolated mountaintops in the Great Basin, where the species is susceptible to localized extirpations. Previous studies from the region related pika extirpations to proxies for climate and habitat quality, or to relatively short datasets on microclimate. This study extends previous research by modeling extirpation using new data from microclimates and microhabitats, and by including data on the vegetation available to individual pikas. We re-surveyed 25 sites historically occupied by pikas, and collected microclimatic and vegetative-cover data from each site. Sites of pika extirpation experienced higher summer temperatures and higher frequency of extremely warm days during 2005-2007 than did sites of pika persistence. Several aspects of vegetative cover also differed between persistence and extirpation sites, and relative forb cover was positively related to pika persistence. Evaluation of competing models within an information-theoretic framework suggests strong support for recent mean summer temperature as the primary driver of extirpations in this dataset. In agreement with other modeling efforts, this result supports the hypothesis that extirpation results from chronic heat stress during the summer months when pikas must gather and store food for the winter. In contrast with previous studies, we found less support for the hypothesis that extirpation results from acute cold stress during the winter months, possibly due to several differences in analytical methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.},

abstract = {Although there are many indicators of endangerment (i.e., whether populations or species meet criteria that justify conservation action), their reliability has rarely been tested. Such indicators may fail to identify that a population or species meets criteria for conservation action (false negative) or may incorrectly show that such criteria have been met (false positive). To quantify the rate of both types of error for 20 commonly used indicators of declining abundance (threat indicators), we used receiver operating characteristic curves derived from historical (1938-2007) data for 18 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations in the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. We retrospectively determined each population's yearly status (reflected by change in abundance over time) on the basis of each indicator. We then compared that population's status in a given year with the status in subsequent years (determined by the magnitude of decline in abundance across those years). For each sockeye population, we calculated how often each indicator of past status matched subsequent status. No single threat indicator provided error-free estimates of status, but indicators that reflected the extent (i.e., magnitude) of past decline in abundance (through comparison of current abundance with some historical baseline abundance) tended to better reflect status in subsequent years than the rate of decline over the previous 3 generations (a widely used indicator). We recommend that when possible, the reliability of various threat indicators be evaluated with empirical analyses before such indicators are used to determine the need for conservation action. These indicators should include estimates from the entire data set to take into account a historical baseline.},

abstract = {Coastal shark populations have been subject to increasing anthropogenic pressure over the past two decades. This study focused on two lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) populations, the site-attached maturing sub-adults at the Island of Bimini, Bahamas, threatened by a large-scale resort development, and adults forming winter aggregations off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, subject to direct fishing pressure. For the sub-adult population, analysis was carried out on the long-term temporal patterns in abundance and population structure, relative to potential driving factors, and the influence of variables affecting longline catch- rates used as the basis for stock assessment. For the aggregating adult population, life-history aspects of population structure and distribution were investigated for relative implications on the species vulnerability status. The following analysis and methodologies were utilised to investigate the two populations: longline catch records from 1982 -- 2008; monitoring of variables potentially affecting longline catch-rates; documentation of shark behavioural interactions with longline equipment using underwater video surveillance; aerial surveying for abundance estimates; comparison of spatial utilisation patterns with longline catch locations; external tagging; the utilisation of archival satellite tags; passive tracking with Vemco acoustic monitoring system and research collaborations with other scientific groups utilising the same acoustic monitoring system. The key findings of this study were that in the northwest Atlantic, N. brevirostris populations are experiencing considerable anthropogenic pressure at all life-stages. In Bimini, the effects of a large-scale resort development have resulted in a significant decline in abundance, to a level ({\~{}}52 individuals) well below the temporal average ({\~{}}158). On the U.S. east coast, seasonal aggregating behaviour has further increased vulnerability through increased catchability, beyond the highly vulnerable status already attributed to this species, and targeted N. brevirostris fisheries appear to be currently operating at unsustainable levels. Shark longline catchability was noted to be significantly influenced by multiple shark presence, resulting in greater susceptibility for N. brevirostris (and other similar species) that naturally exhibit this group behaviour. Incidental encounterability and predation risk significantly influenced longline catch-rates.
Adult N. brevirostris exhibited large-scale seasonal migrations on the U.S. east coast, which, in addition to documented international transitions, supports existing evidence for genetic mixing across the distribution. Water temperature was found to be a significant driver of N. brevirostris behaviour at all life-stages, with an apparent adult temperature preference of {\~{}}24$\backslash$,{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$circ{\}}C. This study represents the first long-term abundance assessment for sub-adult N. brevirostris, and the first in-depth study to focus on an adult N. brevirostris population. The results provide essential life-history information, revealing that at all life-stages N. brevirostris appear to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic activities, relative to other species, and therefore require enhanced management for species protection. It is therefore highly recommended that N. brevirostris be added to the U.S. prohibited species list.},

abstract = {We studied an alpine herbivory gradient established by collared pikas, a small central place foraging lagomorph, to examine the effects of multiple grazing levels on above-ground live biomass (AGB) and species richness (SR) in alpine tundra. The effects of within-season (four sampling periods), multi-season (across three summers) and longer-term dynamics (inferred from spatial location of vegetation with respect to pika haypiles) were examined. Along the grazing gradient, we found support for and against hypotheses that propose biphasic, increasing, or decreasing responses to herbivory, both in terms of AGB and SR. Our results suggest that plant-herbivore predictability is still weak. To further examine the impact of herbivory, we experimentally removed pikas using mesh exclosures placed at increasing distance from the edge of talus occupied by pikas. AGB after the second consecutive year of herbivore exclusion increased by 125{\%} compared to control plots in highly grazed areas adjacent to talus ({\textless}1 m). In more lightly grazed sites at distances 1-6 m from talus, AGB increased by more than 40{\%} after pikas were removed. No differences were observed in the ungrazed sites {\textgreater}6 m from talus. AGB was highest in meadow patches previously grazed by pikas compared to those with little grazing history, but this response was only observed after two seasons following release from herbivory. Grazed sites at distances of 1-6 m had the highest SR. These results indicate that multi-year measurements of growth are particularly relevant in ecosystems dominated by long-lived perennials in regions where productivity is low. Infrequent herbivore vacancies may provide local short-term release from pika grazing, thereby contributing to the persistence of productive, highly palatable vegetation.},

abstract = {Abstract: Several life history traits of sharks result in juveniles being particularly vulnerable to exploitation. However, population level impacts of harvests on juvenile sharks have not been well quantified. This paper examines a range of harvest strategies, including those targeting juveniles. Reproductive value and yield per recruit are used to compare the harvests, which are represented by Leslie matrix models with a harvest matrix. Two species are used as examples: the short-lived Rhizoprionodon taylori and the long-lived Squalus acanthias. Harvests that maintain a stationary population size cause reproductive values to change in opposing ways, but they remove equal fractions of the population's repro- ductive potential. A new theorem gives population growth as a function of the fraction of reproductive potential re- moved by a harvest, a relationship useful for comparing harvests on juveniles and adults. Stochastic projections indicate that the risk of depletion is associated with the fraction of reproductive potential removed annually, a measure which encompasses the information in both the selectivity and the rate of fishing mortality. These results indicate the value of focusing conservation efforts on preserving reproductive potential.},

abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in biodemography and metapopulation ecology, we still have limited understanding of how local demographic parameters influence short- and long-term metapopulation dynamics. We used long-term data from 17 local populations, along with the recently developed methods of matrix metapopulation modeling and transient sensitivity analysis, to investigate the influence of local demography on long-term (asymptotic) versus short-term (transient) dynamics of a yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation in Colorado. Both long- and short-term dynamics depended primarily on a few colony sites and were highly sensitive to changes in demography at these sites, particularly in survival of reproductive adult females. Interestingly, the relative importance of sites differed between long- and short-term dynamics; the spatial structure and local population sizes, while insignificant for asymptotic dynamics, were influential on transient dynamics. However, considering the spatial structure was uninformative about the relative influence of local demography on metapopulation dynamics. The vital rates that were the most influential on local dynamics were also the most influential on both long- and short-term metapopulation dynamics. Our results show that an explicit consideration of local demography is essential for a complete understanding of the dynamics and persistence of spatially structured populations.},

abstract = {SignificanceUnderstanding how social dynamics drive outcomes in environmental systems is critical to advancing global sustainability. We link comprehensive data on fishers information-sharing networks and observed fishing behaviors to demonstrate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact ecological health. Specifically, we find evidence that the propensity for individuals to share information primarily with others most similar to themselves creates segregated networks that impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors--behaviors that could have mitigated the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks in a single commercial fishery between 2008 and 2012. Our results suggest having a better understanding of social structures and bolstering effective communication across segregated networks has the potential to contribute toward more sustainable environmental outcomes. Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.},

He assumes a large number of discrete, identical patches where only a single species can occupy any given patch. All patches are connected via dispersal, but only dispersers landing on empty patches, or those with a weak competitor, can succeed. Competitiion is modeled with a competitive hierarchy. An obvious question is how species affect each other in the heirarchy. A system where one the presence of one species won't elimate another is a noninteractive system. Alternativly, an interactive system means a species could elinate another (one equation's dynamics affects another). For the non-interactive case, Hastings found that an intermediate level of disturbance produced the highest diversity (with a downward facing parabola desribing this relationship). The same is true in the interactive case, but multiple peaks may be present. Hastings also compares his model to coral reef data. 












He found that a poorer competitor must be a better colonizer in order to persist.},

Such research is essential for advancing our understanding of ecological responses associated with climate change, and the physical and biological processes that control them. This need is perhaps greatest for ecosystems that display highly dynamic and spatially complex patterns that are difficult to explain with short-term, small-scale studies. Such is the case for kelp forest ecosystems, which often show tremendous spatial and temporal variability in resource supply, consumer control and physical disturbance across spatial scales of metres to hundreds of kilometres and temporal scales of hours to decades.

abstract = {The spatial component of environment, often neglected in modeling of ecological interactions, in general operates to increase species diversity. This arises due to the heterogeneity of the environment, but such heterogeneity can arise in an initially homogeneous environment due to what may be random initial events (e.g., colonization patterns), effects of which are magnified by species interactions. In this way, homogeneous environments may become heterogeneous and heterogeneous environments even more so. In patchy environments, distinct patches are likely to be colonized initially by different species, and thereby a kind of founder effect results whereby individual patches evolve along different paths simply as a consequence of initial colonization patterns. Species which would be unable to invade may nevertheless survive by establishing themselves early and will moreover be found in lower densities in other areas as overflow from their "safe" areas. Spatially continuous environments may evolve toward essentially patchy ones by this kind of process. Overall species richness is expected to be higher in patchy environments but to decrease as the ability of species to migrate becomes large. These results are due to patchiness per se and do not depend on the existence of several kinds of patches, a situation which will tend to reinforce these effects. Diversity is also increased in such environments with spatial extent due to the opportunities for fugitive-type spatio-temporal strategies. In these, local population oscillations provide the salvation for species which are for example competitively inferior or easy victims to predation but which can survive by superior migratory ability and (in patchy environments) talent for recolonization. Again, dependence is on spatial heterogeneity, in addition to temporal heterogeneity; again, this may be externally imposed or the result largely of internal processes. Some gross statistics for these processes, principally patch occupancy fractions, may prove useful for a simplified treatment of colonization-extinction equilibria, as in the approaches of Cohen (1970), Levins and Culver (1971), Horn and MacArthur (1972), and Slatkin (in preparation). For such considerations, however, one cannot assume independence of distributions; and the approach of Cohen (1970) and Slatkin (in preparation), which allows for consideration of covariance, is favored.},

abstract = {Demographic connectivity is a fundamental process influencing the dynamics and persistence of spatially structured populations. Consequently, quantifying connectivity is essential for properly designing networks of protected areas so that they achieve their core ecological objective of maintaining population persistence. Recently, many empirical studies in marine systems have provided essential, and historically challenging to obtain, data on patterns of larval dispersal and export from marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we review the empirical studies that have directly quantified the origins and destinations of individual larvae and assess those studies' relevance to the theory of population persistence and MPA design objectives. We found that empirical studies often do not measure or present quantities that are relevant to assessing population persistence, even though most studies were motivated or contextualized by MPA applications. Persistence of spatial populations, like nonspatial populations, depends on replacement, whether individuals reproduce enough in their lifetime to replace themselves. In spatial populations, one needs to account for the effect of larval dispersal on future recruitment back to the local population through local retention and other connectivity pathways. The most commonly reported descriptor of larval dispersal was the fraction of recruitment from local origin (self-recruitment). Self-recruitment does not inform persistence-based MPA design because it is a fraction of those arriving, not a fraction of those leaving (local retention), so contains no information on replacement. Some studies presented connectivity matrices, which can inform assessments of persistence with additional knowledge of survival and fecundity after recruitment. Some studies collected data in addition to larval dispersal that could inform assessments of population persistence but which were not presented in that way. We describe how three pieces of empirical information are needed to fully describe population persistence in a network of MPAs: (1) lifetime fecundity, (2) the proportion of larvae that are locally retained (or the full connectivity matrix), and (3) survival rate after recruitment. We conclude by linking theory and data to provide detailed guidance to empiricists and practitioners on field sampling design and data presentation that better informs the MPA objective of population persistence.},

Although migration is widely studied at taxonomically restricted levels, cross-taxonomic syntheses of migration are less common. As a result, we lack answers to broad questions such as what ultimate factors generally drive animal migration. Here we present such a synthesis by using a spatially explicit, individual-based model in which we evolve behavior rules via simulations under a wide range of ecological conditions to answer two questions. First, under what types of ecological conditions can an individual maximize its fitness by migrating (vs. being a resident)? Second, what types of information do individuals use to guide their movement? We show that migration is selected for when resource distributions are dominated more by seasonality than by local patchiness, and residency (nonmigratory behavior) is selected for when the reverse is true. When selected for, migration evolves as both a movement behavior and an information usage strategy. We also find that different types of migration can evolve, depending on the ecological conditions and availability of information. Finally, we present empirical support for our main results, drawn from migration patterns exhibited by a variety of taxonomic groups.},

Buybacks of fishing vessels, licences, access and other rights, and gear, sometimes called decommissioning schemes, have traditionally been a key policy tool to address overcapacity, overexploitation of fish stocks, and distributional issues in fisheries. Two more issues can be added, sustainable use of ecosystems and conservation of biodiversity (i.e. ecological public goods and services) and providing a transition to a more rationalized fishery. This study discusses reasons for buybacks; examines consequences; considers asymmetric information, design of buyback auctions and other design issues; buybacks as a transition to a rationalized industry with strong property rights and governance, financing and transnational fisheries; draws out key lessons from the international experience; and provides an overall evaluation.},

-paper examines reasons for buybacks, consequences, asymmetric information, design, and buybacks as a transition to other fishery types, financing, and international problems

{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}
-can buyback fishing vessels, licenses, access, or the fishing gear itself
-used to address overcapacity, overexploitation of fish stocks and distribution problems in fisheries 
--now fisheries have started being applied in animal conservation and biodiversity tools 
-also used as tool to transition to more sustainable fisheries and fisheries practices

{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}
Purpose:
-address overcapacity, overfishing, and conservation issues

Impacts:
-affects different fishers and crew members in different ways
-can restore profitability for remaining fishermen 
--however, the remaining fishermen then invest more in technology which increases fishing capacity once again 

Asymmetric Information:
-often times costs and benefits can be overlooked when examining buyback authorities and fishers
--many times fishers understand effectiveness of gear and vessels better then the buyback authorities 
--one group may withhold information from the other

-fishers may only leave fishery b/c buyback can rescue an unprofitable business
-investors have less risk when putting money into fishing vessels

-can target wrong vessels for buyout programs
--(i.e.) buying out old fishermen that may have retired soon anyway- happens in Mexico. The resulting fleet then consists of younger vessels that may be better at catching fish in the first place
-to solve these problems, need better screening of vessels 

Conservation/biodiversity:
-using buybacks to address these specific issues (loss of public goods)
-discuss applications in Gulf of California with endangered vaquitas 
-also discusses Pacific leatherback fishery (fishermen were given a one time payment to switch from j hooks to circle hooks, however, the one time payment was not sufficient to make up losses on reduced dolphin-fish catch

Programme design issues:
-set clear goals (avoid contrasting goals)
-clearly defined scope
-must also fulfill 3 conditions before program start (proper license registration, communication between fishers and buyback group, measures to prevent new fishers/technology from entering)
-decide what type of buyout to use
-mandatory or voluntary buyouts
-prevent increases in fishery capacity or spillover to other fisheries
-limit reinvestment or new investment
-determining payment type (i.e. one time payment, multiple payments)
--important in areas that may not have strong alternatives to fisheries
-limiting actual fishing time
-can also associate buybacks with things other than property (i.e. quotas)

Buyback prices and markets:
-different methods to setting buyback prices, most common are fixed prices and auctions. Both have pros and cons. Auctions can reveal true market values
-reverse auctions, reservation prices, releasing bits of information, eligibility requirements, ranking of bids by some metric, sealed vs. open bids, strike price auctions, single vs. multiple rounds

Financing buybacks:
-public vs. privately funded- depends on situation 
-either can produce wrong incentives or moral hazards

Buybacks as transition:
-addresses long-term career changes or displacing of vessels to new areas outside MPA
-can user garner more support from fishers themselves 

Transnational fisheries:
-problems with countries that do or do not put up necessary funds
-need to address new vessels entering fisheries 


Guidelines:
-must start early to achieve a more economic and successful outcome
-buyback design is critical
-more effective when fleets are smaller in number and somewhat homogenous 
-knowing which group of fishers to target
-balance among incentives for different groups and fisheries 
-establishing necessary preconditions are in place
-stakeholder involvement 
-reduce information asymmetry 
-funding of project and sources of funding
-transnational endure a host of other concerns
-buybacks cannot be only solution to problem 


Summary:
-do not address "Tragedy of Commons" and can sometimes make situation worse},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to delineate the circumstances in which fragmentation of breeding habitat affects population survival. Fragmentation is defined (literally) as the breaking apart of habitat; note fragmentation does not imply loss of habitat. I developed a spatially explicit simulation model in which I varied the spatial pattern of breeding habitat in the landscape from contagious to fragmented, while also varying a disturbance regime, breeding habitat permanence, and the life history and movement attributes of organisms living in the landscape. The simulation results suggest that fragmentation of breeding habitat affects population survival only under the following relatively narrow set of conditions: (1) the average between-generation movement distance of the organism is about 1-3 times the expected nearest distance between breeding sites; (2) the breeding habitat of the organism covers less than 20{\%} of the landscape: (3) the habitat is not ephemeral; (4) the organism has high breeding site fidelity; and (5) the mortality rate in the non-breeding habitat areas is much higher than the mortality rate in breeding habitat areas. Note that all of these conditions must hold for there to be an effect of breeding habitat fragmentation on population survival. These results suggest that spatially explicit simulation modelling of population dynamics is only necessary under a relatively narrow range of conditions.},

We have moved from variation for plasticity being considered as a nuisance in evolutionary studies to it being the primary target of investigations that use an array of methods, including quantitative and molecular genetics, as well as of several approaches that model the evolution of plastic responses. Here, I consider some of the major aspects of research on phenotypic plasticity, assessing where progress has been made and where additional effort is required. I suggest that some areas of research, such the study of the quantitative genetic underpinning of plasticity, have been either settled in broad outline or superseded by new approaches and questions.

abstract = {Recent rapid climatic changes are associated with dramatic changes in phenology of plants and animals, with optimal timing of reproduction advancing considerably in the northern hemisphere. However, some species may not have advanced their timing of breeding sufficiently to continue reproducing optimally relative to the occurrence of peak food availability, thus becoming mismatched compared with their food sources. The degree of mismatch may differ among species, and species with greater mismatch may be characterized by declining populations. Here we relate changes in spring migration timing by 100 European bird species since 1960, considered as an index of the phenological response of bird species to recent climate change, to their population trends. Species that declined in the period 1990-2000 did not advance their spring migration, whereas those with stable or increasing populations advanced their migration considerably. On the other hand, population trends during 1970-1990 were predicted by breeding habitat type, northernmost breeding latitude, and winter range (with species of agricultural habitat, breeding at northern latitudes, and wintering in Africa showing an unfavorable conservation status), but not by change in migration timing. The association between population trend in 1990-2000 and change in migration phenology was not confounded by any of the previously identified predictors of population trends in birds, or by similarity in phenotype among taxa due to common descent. Our findings imply that ecological factors affecting population trends can change over time and suggest that ongoing climatic changes will increasingly threaten vulnerable migratory bird species, augmenting their extinction risk.},

When replicated experiments are impossible, construct- ing models and using these to conduct in silico experiments is the next best thing. Recent advances in the construction and analysis of integral projection models (IPMs) mean they offer a remarkably powerful tool to study ecological and evolutionary dynamics. IPMs can be parameterised using data frequently collected by ecologists, but the ease with which they can be constructed and analysed is perhaps not as widely appreciated as it could be. In this paper, which is loosely related to the talk I gave when receiving the Per Brinck Oikos Award in 2012, I show how easily IPMs can be constructed and analysed, and I argue they play an important role in posing and testing hypotheses in population biology.},

abstract = {In recent years, dam management guidelines need to estimate the effects of downstream flow on environment. However, high-flow alters physical conditions such as water depth, flow velocity and water temperature in the downstream side of the river. These changes will lead to alteration in fish habitat of the river. In this paper, an eco-hydraulic model was used to determine the levels of fish habitat in the Colorado River downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam. This model has been proposed by combining hydrodynamic and heat transfer model with a habitat suitability index model based on fish preference curves. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) were chosen as target species because they represent both native and non-native fish in the study area. Flow velocity, water depth and water temperature were selected as the suitability indicators. The hydrological data from three high-flow experiments were analyzed to determine the effects of high-flow on the Colorado River ecosystem. Numerical model simulations were undertaken as follows: firstly, based on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer equation, three hydraulic factors including water depth, velocity and temperature distribution were simulated and the associated suitability for each was obtained based on the fish preference curves. Later, the habitat suitability equation was developed to simulate the target species' habitat situation in high flow effects. Finally, the WUA (weighted usable area) and OSI (overall suitability index) of the spawning fish species were quantitatively calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the high flow. The results show that the effects of three HFE are more severe in spawning flannelmouth sucker than in spawning rainbow trout. It is worth noting that the one day HFE was beneficial to spawning rainbow trout and harmful to spawning flannelmouth sucker but in the HFE of more than 8 days, both the spawning habitats were completely destroyed.},

The relationship between abun- dance and body size has been extensively studied in an attempt to quantify the form of the relationship and to understand the processes that generate it. However, progress has been impeded by the underappreciated fact that there are four distinct, but interrelated, relation- ships between size and abundance that are often con- fused in the literature. Here, we review and distinguish between these four patterns, and discuss the linkages between them.Weargue that a synthetic understanding of size–abundance relationships will result from more detailed analyses of individual patterns and from careful consideration of how and why the patterns are related.},

However, the implications of ECEs for biological invasions remain poorly understood. Using concepts and empirical evidence from invasion ecology, we identify mechanisms by which ECEs may influence the invasion process, from initial introduction through establishment and spread. We summarize how ECEs can enhance invasions by promoting the transport of propagules into new regions, by decreasing the resistance of native communities to establishment, and also sometimes by putting existing non-native species at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, we outline priority research areas and management approaches for anticipating future risks of unwanted invasions following ECEs.

In an attempt to develop and test generic hypotheses explaining these differences, we studied 84 populations of the gray-sided vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in Hokkaido, Japan. We show that these populations are limited by a combination of density-independent factors (such as climate) and density-dependent processes (such as specialist predators). We show that density-dependent regulation primarily occurs in winter months, so that populations experiencing longer winters tend to have a stronger delayed density-dependence and, as a result, exhibit regular density cycles. Altogether, we demonstrate that seasonality plays a key role in determining whether a vole population is cyclic or not.},

abstract = {The notion that predators can affect their prey without killing them is widely
supported in the ecological literature yet rarely applied by marine mammal studies.
We present three case studies in which patterns of time allocation by individual
marine mammal foragers were used to index the sublethal effects of predators on
bottlenose dolphins (
Tursiops
sp.), harbor seals (
Phoca vitulina
), and dugongs (
Dugong
dugon
). In each case, foraging individuals optimized energy gain and safety from
predators by spending less time in more profitable but dangerous patches or de-
creasing their use of risky feeding tactics that would increase net energy gain. By
implication, marine mammals are subject to the non consumptive effects of their
predators (
i.e.
, to intimidation), and fear can mediate their impacts on their resources.
We suggest, therefore, that future studies quantify patterns of time allocation to
measure sublethal effects of predators on marine mammals, as well as the capacity of arine mammals to have sublethal effects on their own prey. We argue that such an
approach is important because non consumptive effects may be of greater magnitude
than lethal effects of predators, and information on sublethal effects of predators can
inform conservation plans and studies of community structure. },

abstract = {Ecologists need an empirical understanding of physiological and behavioural adjustments that animals can make in response to seasonal and long-term variations in environmental conditions. Because many species experience trade-offs between timing and duration of one seasonal event versus another and because interacting species may also shift phenologies at different rates, it is possible that, in aggregate, phenological shifts could result in mismatches that disrupt ecological communities. We investigated the timing of seasonal events over 14 years in two Arctic ground squirrel populations living 20 km apart in Northern Alaska. At Atigun River, snow melt occurred 27 days earlier and snow cover began 17 days later than at Toolik Lake. This spatial differential was reflected in significant variation in the timing of most seasonal events in ground squirrels living at the two sites. Although reproductive males ended seasonal torpor on the same date at both sites, Atigun males emerged from hibernation 9 days earlier and entered hibernation 5 days later than Toolik males. Atigun females emerged and bred 13 days earlier and entered hibernation 9 days earlier than those at Toolik. We propose that this variation in phenology over a small spatial scale is likely generated by plasticity of physiological mechanisms that may also provide individuals the ability to respond to variation in environmental conditions over time.},

A demonstrated sensitivity to climate variability, coupled with poor dispersal ability and the naturally fragmented nature of its populations, heightens the vulnerability of this small mammal to climate change. The species is well-studied in a very limited portion of its range, but baseline information on population trends at the range level, and a clear understanding of the extent and severity of climate impacts to this species and its habitat in the coming decades is limited. However, the best available information suggests that this species may be particularly sensitive to a changing climate, including concomitant increases in precipitation variability, leading to reductions in habitat availability. The potential of negative impacts of climate change to the persistence of this species over the long term is substantial.},

We calculated habitat condition in four ways, using different human impacts as a proxy for condition: all impacts; impacts that cannot be managed with a reserve; land-based impacts; and climate change impacts. We demonstrate our approach in California, where three important tradeoffs emerged. First, reserve systems that have a high chance of protecting good condition habitats cost fishers less than 3.1{\%} of their income. Second, cost to fishers can be reduced by 1/2–2/3 by triaging less than 1/3 of habitats. Finally, increasing the probability of protecting good condition habitats from 50{\%} to 99{\%} costs fishers an additional 1.7{\%} of their income, with roughly 0.3{\%} added costs for each additional 10{\%} confidence. Knowing exactly what the cost of these tradeoffs are informs discussion and potential compromise among stakeholders involved in protected area planning worldwide.},

abstract = {We synthesize results from existing models of marine reserves to identify key theoretical issues that appear to be well understood, as well as issues in need of further exploration. Models of marine reserves are relatively new in the scientific literature; 32 of the 34 theoretical papers we reviewed were published after 1990. These models have focused primarily on questions concerning fishery management at the expense of other objectives such as conservation, scientific understanding, recreation, education, and tourism. Roughly one-third of the models analyze effects on cohorts while the remaining models have some form of complete population dynamics. Few models explicitly include larval dispersal. In a fisheries context, the primary conclusion drawn by many of the complete population models is that reserves increase yield when populations would otherwise be overfished. A second conclusion, resulting primarily from single-cohort models, is that reserves will provide fewer benefits for species with greater adult rates of movement. Although some models are beginning to yield information on the spatial configurations of reserves required for populations with specific dispersal distances to persist, it remains an aspect of reserve design in need of further analysis. Other outstanding issues include the effects of (1) particular forms of density dependence, (2) multispecies interactions, (3) fisher behavior, and (4) effects of concentrated fishing on habitat. Model results indicate that marine reserves could play a beneficial role in the protection of marine systems against overfishing. Ad- ditional modeling and analysis will greatly improve prospects for a better understanding of the potential of marine reserves for conserving biodiversity.},

Hastings (1977) developed a simple predator-prey model in a metapopulation of identical patches. He then looked at which combinations of parameters produced which dynamics. He found that when predator dispersal is too low, the predator will go extinct. If predator dispersal is high, but prey dispersal is low, there is no stable equilbrium. If both predator and prey dispersal is high there is stability. Thus, depending on the life history traits of the predator and prey, predatation can be stabalizing. 


I'm not sure where the spatial heterogeneity comes in; is it simply the fact that you have patches? 


Key assumptions:
-*global dispersal among patches
-all patches identical
-can have empty, prey only, or predator and prey patches
-ignore within patch dynamics (Caswell 1977)

THe location of the nontrivial equilbrium is important (if stochastic fluctuations are present)

We propose a framework based on the {\~{}}25 elements represented in biology, which can serve as a conduit for a general exploration of poorly understood evolution-to-ecology links. In this framework, known as ecological stoichiometry, the quantity of elements in the inorganic realm is a fundamental environment, while the flow of elements from the abi- otic to the biotic realm is due to the action of genomes, with the unused ele- ments excreted back into the inorganic realm affecting ecological processes at higher levels of organization. Ecological stoichiometry purposefully assumes dis- tinct elemental composition of species, enabling powerful predictions about the ecological functions of species. However, this assumption results in a simplified view of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying diversification in the elemental composition of species. Recent research indicates substantial intraspecific varia- tion in elemental composition and associated ecological functions such as nutri- ent excretion. We posit that attention to intraspecific variation in elemental composition will facilitate a synthesis of stoichiometric information in light of population genetics theory for a rigorous exploration of the ecological conse- quences of evolutionary change.},

TheGBRcontinues to be a highly regarded dive destination, with divers perceiving positive effects of protection within MPAs.

Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. Further, the exploitation rate for sharks as a group was calculated by dividing two independent mortality estimates by an estimate of total global biomass. As an alternative approach, exploitation rates for individual shark populations were compiled and averaged from stock assessments and other published sources. The resulting three independent estimates of the average exploitation rate ranged between 6.4{\%} and 7.9{\%} of sharks killed per year. This exceeds the average rebound rate for many shark populations, estimated from the life history information on 62 shark species (rebound rates averaged 4.9{\%} per year), and explains the ongoing declines in most populations for which data exist. The consequences of these unsustainable catch and mortality rates for marine ecosystems could be substantial. Global total shark mortality, therefore, needs to be reduced drastically in order to rebuild depleted populations and restore marine ecosystems with functional top predators.},

abstract = {Hourly fluctuations in flow from Glen Canyon Dam were increased in an attempt to limit the population of nonnative rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Colorado River, Arizona, due to concerns about negative effects of nonnative trout on endangered native fishes. Controlled floods have also been conducted to enhance native fish habitat. We estimated that rainbow trout incubation mortality rates resulting from greater fluctuations in flow were 23-49{\%} (2003 and 2004) compared with 5-11{\%} under normal flow fluctuations (2006-2010). Effects of this mortality were apparent in redd excavations but were not seen in hatch date distributions or in the abundance of the age-0 population. Multiple lines of evidence indicated that a controlled flood in March 2008, which was intended to enhance native fish habitat, resulted in a large increase in early survival rates of age-0 rainbow trout. Age-0 abundance in July 2008 was over fourfold higher than expected given the number of viable eggs that produced these fish. A hatch date analysis indicated that early survival rates were much higher for cohorts that hatched about 1 month after the controlled flood (approx. April 15) relative to those that hatched before this date. The cohorts that were fertilized after the flood were not exposed to high flows and emerged into better-quality habitat with elevated food availability. Interannual differences in age-0 rainbow trout growth based on otolith microstructure supported this hypothesis. It is likely that strong compensation in survival rates shortly after emergence mitigated the impact of incubation losses caused by increases in flow fluctuations. Control of nonnative fish populations will be most effective when additional mortality is applied to older life stages after the majority of density-dependent mortality has occurred. Our study highlights the need to rigorously assess instream flow decisions through the evaluation of population-level responses.},

Theory sug- gests myriad processes by which range limits arise, including competitive exclusion, Allee effects, and gene swamping; however, most models remain empirically untested. Range limits are correlated with a number of abiotic and biotic factors, but further experimentation is needed to understand un- derlying mechanisms. Range edges are characterized by increased genetic isolation, genetic differentiation, and variability in individual and population performance, but evidence for decreased abundance and fitness is lacking. Evolution of range limits is understudied in natural systems; in particular, the role of gene flow in shaping range limits is unknown. Biological invasions and rapid distribution shifts caused by climate change represent large-scale experiments on the underlying dynamics of range limits. A better fusion of experimentation and theory will advance our understanding of the causes of range limits.},

abstract = {Despite being the world's largest rays and providing significant revenue through dive tourism, little is known about the population status, exploitation and trade volume of the Mobulidae (mobulids; Manta and Mobula spp.). There is anecdotal evidence, however, that mobulid populations are declining, largely due to the recent emergence of a widespread trade for their gill rakers, which is reflected in increasing Food and Agriculture Organization landings trends. Here, we present results from two dedicated diver surveys, one from the eManta project, which includes summary observations from ninety 10ux10u regions with ,200–62,000 dives per region, and the other from the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, which includes spatially more detailed observations from 3 regions with ,4,000–118,000 dives per region. We show that mobulids as a group, which includes eleven species, have globally and regionally restricted distributions, typically have low sighting frequency (,1{\%} of dives) and aggregate in only a few locations. Of the regions surveyed by divers, almost half (47{\%}) report declining mobulid sightings over the last decade. Divers indicate that although mobulid ecotourism occurs in many regions (45{\%} of those reported, n = 41) they are considered protected in only 32{\%} of the regions. Mobulids being fished or sold in local markets were reported from 16{\%} and 12{\%} of regions, respectively, with most being adjacent to mobulid abundance hotspot and ecotourism regions (e.g. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, east Africa). Identification of regions where ecotourism and exploitation are at odds could help prioritize conservation efforts. Vulnerability analysis, using life history characteristics, indicates that Manta spp. are vulnerable to exploitation, tolerating only low fishing mortality rates; data limitations prohibited such analysis for Mobula spp. Our analyses support previous studies in showing the need for improved conservation and monitoring efforts, and suggest that international and enforceable management policies are required to prevent further population decline.},

abstract = {The upstream migration of adult anadromous salmonids in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) has been dramatically altered and fish may be experiencing energetically costly delays at dams. To explore this notion, we estimated the energetic costs of migration and reproduction of Yakima River-bound spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha using a sequential analysis of their proximate composition (i.e., percent water, fat, protein, and ash). Tissues (muscle, viscera, and gonad) were sampled from fish near the start of their migration (Bonneville Dam), at a mid point (Roza Dam, 510km upstream from Bonneville Dam) and from fresh carcasses on the spawning grounds (about 100km above Roza Dam). At Bonneville Dam, the energy reserves of these fish were remarkably high, primarily due to the high percentage of fat in the muscle (18–20{\%}; energy content over 11 kJ g?1). The median travel time for fish from Bonneville to Roza Dam was 27 d and ranged from 18 to 42 d. Fish lost from 6 to 17{\%} of their energy density in muscle, depending on travel time. On average, fish taking a relatively long time for migration between dams used from 5 to 8{\%}more energy from the muscle than faster fish. From the time they passed Bonneville Damto death, these fish, depending on gender, used 95–99{\%} of their muscle and 73–86{\%} of their visceral lipid stores. Also, both sexes used about 32{\%} of their muscular and very little of their visceral protein stores. However, we were unable to relate energy use and reproductive success to migration history. Our results suggest a possible influence of the CRB hydroelectric system on adult salmonid energetics},

abstract = {1. This review synthesizes evidence that altered fire frequency drives discontinuous ecosystem transitions from mesic grasslands to shrublands or woodlands in the Central Great Plains, USA. 2. Long-term fire manipulations reveal that grassland to shrubland transitions are triggered when fire-free intervals increase from 1–3 years to ≥ 3–8 years, and longer fire returns (˜10 years or more) result in transitions to woodlands. Grazing and soil properties alter these fire thresholds. 3. Grassland to shrubland transitions are abrupt and exhibit nonlinear relationships between driver and state variables. Transitions to shrublands and woodlands exhibit hysteresis, where reintroducing frequent fires does not reverse transitions in management-relevant time-scales (decades). 4. Nonlinear transitions and hysteresis emerge because grasses generate positive feedbacks with fire that create strong demographic barriers for shrub and tree establishment. Fire-free intervals allow shrubs and trees to reach a size sufficient to survive fire, reproduce and disrupt the fire feedback loop through competition. 5. Synthesis. Mesic grasslands, shrublands and woodlands constitute self-reinforcing states (alternative attractors) separated by critical fire frequency thresholds. Even without major shifts in climate, altered fire frequency can produce dramatic state changes, highlighting the importance of fire for predicting future ecosystem states. Local management should focus on prevention of unwanted transitions rather than post hoc restoration.},

abstract = {Abstract Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

However, data on population structure might be considered as patterns that contain valuable information to estimate missing parameters indirectly. As an example for this pattern-oriented modelling and parameterization, pre-breeding survival rate of the endangered Lesser Spot- ted Woodpecker (Picoides minor) was determined here using data on population structure (e.g. sex ratio) and reproductive success at the population level (e.g. nesting success). There- fore, an individual-based model was developed simulating the population dynamics for two different populations that had been empirically studied at Lake Mockeln, Sweden, and Taunus, Germany. For both populations, a small range for pre-breeding survival rates could be identified wherein all simulated patterns corresponded best to the empirical values. Pre- breeding survival rate was found to be higher in the German scenario than in the Swedish and geographical variation in life-history traits is discussed as a possible reason. It is concluded that the pattern-oriented approach is a valuable method for estimating missing demographic parameters, even when using weak patterns from empirical investigations. Furthermore, it was shown that the use of multiple patterns is necessary for this purpose.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Human impacts on the world's oceans have been substantial, leading to concerns about the extinction of marine taxa. We have compiled 133 local, regional and global extinctions of marine populations. There is typically a 53-year lag between the last sighting of an organism and the reported date of the extinction at whatever scale this has occurred. Most disappearances (80{\%}) were detected using indirect historical comparative methods, which suggests that marine extinctions may have been underestimated because of low-detection power. Exploitation caused most marine losses at various scales (55{\%}), followed closely by habitat loss (37{\%}), while the remainder were linked to invasive species, climate change, pollution and disease. Several perceptions concerning the vulnerability of marine organisms appear to be too general and insufficiently conservative. Marine species cannot be considered less vulnerable on the basis of biological attributes such as high fecundity or large-scale dispersal characteristics. For commercially exploited species, it is often argued that economic extinction of exploited populations will occur before biological extinction, but this is not the case for non-target species caught in multispecies fisheries or species with high commercial value, especially if this value increases as species become rare. The perceived high potential for recovery, high variability and low extinction vulnerability of fish populations have been invoked to avoid listing commercial species of fishes under international threat criteria. However, we need to learn more about recovery, which may be hampered by negative population growth at small population sizes (Allee effect or depensation) or ecosystem shifts, as well as about spatial dynamics and connectivity of subpopulations before we can truly understand the nature of responses to severe depletions. The evidence suggests that fish populations do not fluctuate more than those of mammals, birds and butterflies, and that fishes may exhibit vulnerability similar to mammals, birds and butterflies. There is an urgent need for improved methods of detecting marine extinctions at various spatial scales, and for predicting the vulnerability of species.},

abstract = {Abstract. Accurately surveying shark populations is critical to monitoring precipitous ongoing declines in shark abundance and interpreting the effects that these reductions are having on ecosystems. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing survey tools, we used field trials and computer simulations to critically examine the operation of four common methods for counting coastal sharks: stationary point counts, belt transects, video surveys, and mark and recapture abundance estimators. Empirical and theoretical results suggest that (1) survey method selection has a strong impact on the estimates of shark density that are produced, (2) standardizations by survey duration are needed to properly interpret and compare survey outputs, (3) increasing survey size does not necessarily increase survey precision, and (4) methods that yield the highest density estimates are not always the most accurate. These findings challenge some of the assumptions traditionally associated with surveying mobile marine animals. Of the methods we trialed, 8 3 50 m belt transects and a 20 m radius point count produced the most accurate estimates of shark density. These findings can help to improve the ways we monitor, manage, and understand the ecology of globally imperiled coastal shark populations.},

abstract = {Overfishing of sharks is a global concern, with increasing numbers of species threatened by overfishing. For many sharks, both catch rates and underwater visual surveys have been criticized as indices of abundance. In this context, estimation of population trends using individual demographic rates provides an important alternative means of assessing population status. However, such estimates involve uncertainties that must be appropriately characterized to credibly and effectively inform conservation efforts and management. Incorporating uncertainties into population assessment is especially important when key demographic rates are obtained via indirect methods, as is often the case for mortality rates of marine organisms subject to fishing. Here, focusing on two reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, we estimated natural and total mortality rates using several indirect methods, and determined the population growth rates resulting from each. We used bootstrapping to quantify the uncertainty associated with each estimate, and to evaluate the extent of agreement between estimates. Multiple models produced highly concordant natural and total mortality rates, and associated population growth rates, once the uncertainties associated with the individual estimates were taken into account. Consensus estimates of natural and total population growth across multiple models support the hypothesis that these species are declining rapidly due to fishing, in contrast to conclusions previously drawn from catch rate trends. Moreover, quantitative projections of abundance differences on fished versus unfished reefs, based on the population growth rate estimates, are comparable to those found in previous studies using underwater visual surveys. These findings appear to justify management actions to substantially reduce the fishing mortality of reef sharks. They also highlight the potential utility of rigorously characterizing uncertainty, and applying multiple assessment methods, to obtain robust estimates of population trends in species threatened by overfishing.},

Current experimental and theoretical results emphasize how the interplay between inheritance processes and absolute fitness in changed environments drive population dynamics and determine prospects of extinction.

The disease leads to behavioral changes, lesions, loss of turgor, limb autotomy, and death characterized by rapid degradation ("melting"). Here, we present evidence from experimental challenge studies and field observations that link the mass mortalities to a densovirus (Parvoviridae). Virus-sized material (i.e., {\textless}0.2 $\mu$m) from symptomatic tissues that was inoculated into asymptomatic asteroids consistently resulted in SSWD signs whereas animals receiving heat-killed (i.e., control) virus-sized inoculum remained asymptomatic. Viral metagenomic investigations revealed the sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV) as the most likely candidate virus associated with tissues from symptomatic asteroids. Quantification of SSaDV during transmission trials indicated that progression of SSWD paralleled increased SSaDV load. In field surveys, SSaDV loads were more abundant in symptomatic than in asymptomatic asteroids. SSaDV could be detected in plankton, sediments and in nonasteroid echinoderms, providing a possible mechanism for viral spread. SSaDV was detected in museum specimens of asteroids from 1942, suggesting that it has been present on the North American Pacific Coast for at least 72 y. SSaDV is therefore the most promising candidate disease agent responsible for asteroid mass mortality.},

The significance of the following factors to metapopulation dynamics are explored: evolutionary changes in colonization ability; habitat patch size and isolation; compensatory effects between colonization and extinction rates; the effect of immigration on local dynamics (the rescue effect); and heterogeneity among habitat patches. The rescue effect may lead to alternative stable equilibria in metapopulation dynamics. Heterogeneity among habitat patches may give rise to a bimodal equilibrium distribution of the fraction of patches occupied in an assemblage of species (the core-satellite distribution). A new model of incidence functions is described, which allows one to estimate species' colonization and extinction rates on islands colonized from mainland. Four distinct kinds of stochasticity affecting metapopulation dynamics are discussed with examples. The concluding section describes four possible scenarios of metapopulation extinction.},

abstract = {Population dynamics are affected by changes in both the mean and standard deviation of climate, e.g., changes in average temperature are likely to affect populations, but so are changes in the strength of year-to-year temperature variability. The impacts of increases in average temperature are extensively researched, while the impacts of changes in climate variability are less studied. Is the greater attention given to changes in mean environment justified? To help answer this question we developed a simple population model, explicitly linked to an environmental process. We used the model to compare the sensitivities of a population's long-term stochastic growth rate, a measure of fitness, to changes in the mean and standard deviation of the environment. Results are interpreted in light of a comparative analysis of the relative magnitudes of change in means and standard deviations of biologically relevant climate variables in the United States. Results show that changes in the variability of the environment can be more important for many populations. Changes in mean conditions are likely to have a greater impact than changes in variability on populations far from their ideal environment, for example, populations near species range boundaries and potentially of conservation concern. Populations near range centres and close to their ideal environment are more likely to be affected by changes in variability. Among pest and insect disease vectors, as well as species of commercial value, populations likely to be of greatest economic and public health significance are those near species range centers, living in a near-ideal environment for the species. Observed changes in the variability of climate variables may benefit these populations.},

abstract = {Adaptive dynamics theory has been devised to account for feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes. Doing so opens new dimensions to and raises new challenges about evolutionary rescue. Adaptive dynamics theory predicts that successive trait substitutions driven by eco-evolutionary feedbacks can gradually erode population size or growth rate, thus potentially raising the extinction risk. Even a single trait substitution can suffice to degrade population viability drastically at once and cause 'evolutionary suicide'. In a changing environment, a population may track a viable evolutionary attractor that leads to evolutionary suicide, a phenomenon called 'evolutionary trapping'. Evolutionary trapping and suicide are commonly observed in adaptive dynamics models in which the smooth variation of traits causes catastrophic changes in ecological state. In the face of trapping and suicide, evolutionary rescue requires that the population overcome evolutionary threats generated by the adaptive process itself. Evolutionary repellors play an important role in determining how variation in environmental conditions correlates with the occurrence of evolutionary trapping and suicide, and what evolutionary pathways rescue may follow. In contrast with standard predictions of evolutionary rescue theory, low genetic variation may attenuate the threat of evolutionary suicide and small population sizes may facilitate escape from evolutionary traps.},

abstract = {Sexual selection, through intra-male competition or female choice, is assumed to be a source of strong and sustained directional selection in the wild. In the presence of such strong directional selection, alleles enhancing a particular trait are predicted to become fixed within a population, leading to a decrease in the underlying genetic variation. However, there is often considerable genetic variation underlying sexually selected traits in wild populations, and consequently, this phenomenon has become a long-discussed issue in the field of evolutionary biology. In wild Soay sheep, large horns confer an advantage in strong intra-sexual competition, yet males show an inherited polymorphism for horn type and have substantial genetic variation in their horn size. Here we show that most genetic variation in this trait is maintained by a trade-off between natural and sexual selection at a single gene, relaxin-like receptor 2 (RXFP2). We found that an allele conferring larger horns, Ho(+), is associated with higher reproductive success, whereas a smaller horn allele, Ho(P), confers increased survival, resulting in a net effect of overdominance (that is, heterozygote advantage) for fitness at RXFP2. The nature of this trade-off is simple relative to commonly proposed explanations for the maintenance of sexually selected traits, such as genic capture ('good genes') and sexually antagonistic selection. Our results demonstrate that by identifying the genetic architecture of trait variation, we can determine the principal mechanisms maintaining genetic variation in traits under strong selection and explain apparently counter-evolutionary observations.},
annote = {Although the idea of maintained genetic variation makes a lot of intuitive sense, under sexual selection (which should be directional), it is unclear how this variation would persist. The trait that is being selected for should become fixed in the population. In Soay sheep, large horns offer an advantage when males compete for mates. Yet, a polymorphism still exists at a locus determining horn type and size. This locus explained almost all of the genetic variation for both horn type and size. One version of the allele is correlated with greater reproductive success (big horn allele) and the other allele increases survival rate. The combination of these two processes leads to overdominance (the heterozygote being favored). Instead of proposing some crazy mechanism for how this polymorphism could exist, it just took getting to the actual mechanisms to explain what is happening. 




I wonder if this mechanism could have been started because a small population was intially isolated on the island.

State-space models are partitioned into an underlying system process describing the transitions of the true states of the system over time and the observation process linking the observations of the system to the true states. Open population capture-recapture-recovery data can be modelled in this framework by regarding the system process as the state of each individual observed within the study in terms of being alive or dead, and the observation process the recapture and/or recovery process. The traditional observation error of a state-space model is incorporated via the recapture/recovery probabilities being less than unity. The models can be fitted using a Bayesian data augmentation approach and in standard BUGS packages. Applying this state-space framework to such data permits additional complexities including individual heterogeneity to be fitted to the data at very little additional programming effort. We consider the efficiency of the state-space model fitting approach by considering a random effects model for capture-recapture data relating to dippers and compare different Bayesian model-fitting algorithms within WinBUGS.},

abstract = {In seasonal populations, vital rates are not only determined by the direct effects of density at the beginning of each season, but also by density at the beginning of past seasons. Such delayed density dependence can arise via non-lethal effects on individuals that carry over to influence per capita rates. In this study, we examine (i) whether parental breeding density influences offspring size, (ii) how this could carry over to affect offspring survival during the subsequent non-breeding period and (iii) the population consequences of this relationship. Using Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, submitted to distinct breeding and non-breeding seasons, we first used a controlled laboratory experiment to show that high parental breeding density leads to small offspring size, which then affects offspring survival during the non-breeding period but only at high non-breeding densities. We then show that a model with the interaction between parental breeding density and offspring density at the beginning of the non-breeding season best explained offspring survival over 36 replicated generations. Finally, we developed a biseasonal model to show that the positive relationship between parental density and offspring survival can dampen fluctuations in population size between breeding and non-breeding seasons. These results highlight how variation in parental density can lead to differences in offspring quality which result in important non-lethal effects that carry over to influence per capita rates the following season, and demonstrate how this phenomenon can have important implications for the long-term dynamics of seasonal populations.},

abstract = {Ecosystems and the species and communities within them are highly complex systems that defy predictions with any degree of certainty. Managing and conserving these systems in the face of uncertainty remains a daunting challenge, particularly with respect to developing networks of marine reserves. Here we review several modelling frameworks that explicitly acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty, and then use these methods to evaluate reserve spacing rules given increasing levels of uncertainty about larval dispersal distances. Our approach finds similar spacing rules as have been proposed elsewhere - roughly 20-200 km - but highlights several advantages provided by uncertainty modelling over more traditional approaches to developing these estimates. In particular, we argue that uncertainty modelling can allow for (1) an evaluation of the risk associated with any decision based on the assumed uncertainty; (2) a method for quantifying the costs and benefits of reducing uncertainty; and (3) a useful tool for communicating to stakeholders the challenges in managing highly uncertain systems. We also argue that incorporating rather than avoiding uncertainty will increase the chances of successfully achieving conservation and management goals.},

abstract = {Phenology affects nearly all aspects of ecology and evolution. Virtually all biological phenomena-from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes-have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.},

This paper was primarily a "methods" type paper that tried to use DNA tags (RAD tags) to examine fine scale relationships. Usually it would be very expensive to simply sequence a whole bunch of closely related species or populations to examine differences between them. Rad tag technique is relatively inexpensive and allows for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms. I thought it was interesting that RAD tags can be used even without any prior genomic information. This aspect, combined with its cost, make it very attractive. 

        
The paper examined a single pitcher plant mosquito species across a number of populations in North America. Using the Rad tag sequences, the authors were able to constuct a phylogeny for the various populations and were able to group them into specific clades. Such a detailed phylogeny from RAD tag data gave me some interesting ideas of how to study a system of small mammals I{\&}{\#}039;ve been working on. 

        

        
Technology
Six individuals for each of the 21 distinct populations were sampled. SNPs were then identified using RAD tag techniques. This SNP dataset was then analyzed using a number of statisitcal methods to construct a phylogeny. I think it would be interesting to test this technique, and I{\&}{\#}039;m sure people have now, with sequencing of whole genomes from a number of populations to see how well RAD tag techniques perfor. },

AD models are probably better for describing long term evolution whee selection depends on rare innovations and fitness funcitons change over time because of density and freq depend.


Summary:
Function-valued traits arise naturally in a number of ecological scenarios.The evolution of function-valued traits was first developed in a quant gen framework. However, much of this work dealt with frequency-independent selection. An adaptive dynamics framework allows for the study of long-term evolution under more realstictic scenarios of freeqeucy-dependent selection. They point out that two important consideration in these models are evolutionary constraits and the use of infinite-dimensional traits instead of a lower dimensional approximation. They discuss a hierarchy of three models: 1) polymorphic stochastic model, which is a full, individual based model of eco-evolutionary dynamics, 2) monomorphic stochastic model assumes that ecological and evolutiontionary timescales are seperate, and lastly 3) monomorphic deterministic model, which is a deterministic version of the monomorphic stochastic model. They focus on the monomorphic stochastic model and derive a canonical equation of function-valued adaptive dynamics. They apply function valued adaptive dynamics models to two common scenarios. In the first, the examine the evolution of metabolic investment startegies. 

In addition to deriving the canonical equation for function-valued adaptive dynamics and providing a useful framework, the second example discribed in Dieckmann et al 2006 is of use to our work on pikas. Here they desribe a model of seasonal flowering schedules in a temporlly varying environment. Flowers have to compete for pollinators and avoid herbivores, both of which can vary over the course of the season. They numerically solve for an evolutionary singular strategy of flowering output of the course of a season given a particular set up constraits. They find that flowering schedule tends to a global evolutionary attractor set by the resource availability.},

abstract = {The timing of biological events (phenology) is an important aspect of both a species' life cycle and how it interacts with other species and its environment. Patterns of phenological change have been given much scientific attention, particularly recently in relation to climate change. For pairs of interacting species, if their rates of phenological change differ, then this may lead to asynchrony between them and disruption of their ecological interactions. However it is often difficult to interpret differential rates of phenological change and to predict their ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review theoretical results regarding this topic, with special emphasis on those arising from life history theory, evolutionary game theory and population dynamic models. Much ecological research on phenological change builds upon the concept of match/mismatch, so we start by putting forward a simple but general model that captures essential elements of this concept. We then systematically compare the predictions of this baseline model with expectations from theory in which additional ecological mechanisms and features of species life cycles are taken into account. We discuss the ways in which the fitness consequences of interspecific phenological asynchrony may be weak, strong, or idiosyncratic. We discuss theory showing that synchrony is not necessarily an expected evolutionary outcome, and how population densities are not necessarily maximized by adaptation, and the implications of these findings. By bringing together theoretical developments regarding the eco-evolutionary consequences of phenological asynchrony, we provide an overview of available alternative hypotheses for interpreting empirical patterns as well as the starting point for the next generation of theory in this field.},

abstract = {Little is known about how specific anthropogenic hazards affect the biology of organisms. Quantifying the effect of regional hazards is particularly challenging for species such as sea turtles because they are migratory, difficult to study, long lived, and face multiple anthropogenic threats. Expert elicitation, a technique used to synthesize opinions of experts while assessing uncertainty around those views, has been in use for several decades in the social science and risk assessment sectors. We conducted an internet-based survey to quantify expert opinion on the relative magnitude of anthropogenic hazards to sea turtle populations at the regional level. Fisheries bycatch and coastal development were most often ranked as the top hazards to sea turtle species in a geographic region. Nest predation and direct take followed as the second and third greatest threats, respectively. Survey results suggest most experts believe sea turtles are threatened by multiple factors, including substantial at-sea threats such as fisheries bycatch. Resources invested by the sea turtle community, however, appear biased toward terrestrial-based impacts. Results from the survey are useful for conservation planning because they provide estimates of relative impacts of hazards on sea turtles and a measure of consensus on the magnitude of those impacts among researchers and practitioners. Our survey results also revealed patterns of expert bias, which we controlled for in our analysis. Respondents with no experience with respect to a sea turtle species tended to rank hazards affecting that sea turtle species higher than respondents with experience. A more-striking pattern was with hazard-based expertise: the more experience a respondent had with a specific hazard, the higher the respondent scored the impact of that hazard on sea turtle populations. Bias-controlled expert opinion surveys focused on threatened species and their hazards can help guide and expedite species recovery plans.},

abstract = {How biological diversity is generated and maintained is a fundamental question in ecology. Ecologists have delineated many mechanisms that can, in principle, favor species coexistence and hence maintain biodiversity. Most such coexistence mechanisms require or imply tradeoffs between different aspects of species performance. However, it remains unknown whether simple functional tradeoffs underlie coexistence mechanisms in diverse natural systems. We show that functional tradeoffs explain species differences in long-term population dynamics that are associated with recovery from low density (and hence coexistence) for a community of winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. We develop a new general framework for quantifying the magnitude of coexistence via the storage effect and use this framework to assess the strength of the storage effect in the winter annual community. We then combine a 25-year record of vital rates with morphological and physiological measurements to identify functional differences between species in the growth and reproductive phase of the life cycle that promote storage-effect coexistence. Separation of species along a tradeoff between growth capacity and low-resource tolerance corresponds to differences in demographic responses to environmental variation across years. Growing season precipitation is one critical environmental variable underlying the demographic decoupling of species. These results demonstrate how partially decoupled population dynamics that promote local biodiversity are associated with physiological differences in resource uptake and allocation between species. These results for a relatively simple system demonstrate how long-term community dynamics relate to functional biology, a linkage scientists have long sought for more complex systems.},

Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition--two processes important in all ecosystems--are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40{\%}) reduced plant production by 5-10{\%}, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60{\%}) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO(2) and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO(2) and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts.},

In fact, many of the main ecological candidates for low-dimensional chaos are continuous-time host-parasite and predator-prey systems, driven by strong seasonal `forcing' of one or more population parameters. This paper, therefore, explores the relation between seasonal forcing and metapopulation extinction for such systems. We base the analysis on extensive simulations of a stochastic metapopulation model for measles, based on a standard compartmental model, tracking the density of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered individuals (the SEIR model). The results show that, by contrast with coupled logistic maps, the increased seasonality which causes chaos maintains or increases levels of global extinction of infection, by increasing the synchrony of sub-population epidemics. The model also illustrates that the population interaction (here between susceptible and infective hosts) has a significant effect on patterns of synchrony and extinction.

abstract = {Abstract Coastal biodiversity is threatened worldwide by both direct and indirect anthropogenic activities. To more ef- fectively manage and protect coastal biodiversity, accurate assessments of genetic, species, and ecosystem level diversity are required. We present the results from an assessment of the aquatic species diversity of a small (3 km2), shallow, mangrove- fringed Bahamian lagoon (the North Sound) subject to ongoing anthropogenic development. The assessment was conducted through a collation of field observations and data in published literature. We found that eight angiosperm species, 30 macro- algal species, and 370 animal species (including 95 fishes, 69 arthropods, 56 birds, and 45 mollusks) were documented within the lagoon. At least 11 of these species are of conser- vation concern, such as the critically endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) and hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). Comparisons of community similarity indicated that the North Sound has a relatively distinct fauna and flora, but available data suggest that the species found there are most similar to those found in nearby habitats in Cuba. The lagoon forms a key nursery habitat for many species, including lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris), Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus), and queen conch (Strombas gigas). Recently, the lagoon was included as part of a new marine protected area (MPA), but much of the habitat has already experienced considerable anthropogenic disturbance and the MPA boundaries have yet to be established. We have therefore analyzed the lagoon biodiversity and expect the data presented here to serve as a baseline for future comparisons.},

This issue--commonly referred to as the diversity-stability debate--is the subject of this review, which synthesizes historical ideas with recent advances. Both theory and empirical evidence agree that we should expect declines in diversity to accelerate the simplification of ecological communities.},

abstract = {1. Climate change has been shown to affect the phenology of many organisms, but interestingly these shifts are often unequal across trophic levels, causing a mismatch between the phenology of organisms and their food. 2. We consider two alternative hypotheses: consumers are constrained to adjust sufficiently to the lower trophic level, or prey species react more strongly than their predators to reduce predation. We discuss both hypotheses with our analyses of changes in phenology across four trophic levels: tree budburst, peak biomass of herbivorous caterpillars, breeding phenology of four insectivorous bird species and an avian predator. 3. In our long-term study, we show that between 1988 and 2005, budburst advanced (not significantly) with 0.17 d yr(-1), while between 1985 and 2005 both caterpillars (0.75 d year(-1)) and the hatching date of the passerine species (range for four species: 0.36-0.50 d year(-1)) have advanced, whereas raptor hatching dates showed no trend. 4. The caterpillar peak date was closely correlated with budburst date, as were the passerine hatching dates with the peak caterpillar biomass date. In all these cases, however, the slopes were significantly less than unity, showing that the response of the consumers is weaker than that of their food. This was also true for the avian predator, for which hatching dates were not correlated with the peak availability of fledgling passerines. As a result, the match between food demand and availability deteriorated over time for both the passerines and the avian predators. 5. These results could equally well be explained by consumers' insufficient responses as a consequence of constraints in adapting to climate change, or by them trying to escape predation from a higher trophic level, or both. Selection on phenology could thus be both from matches of phenology with higher and lower levels, and quantifying these can shed new light on why some organisms do adjust their phenology to climate change, while others do not.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are widely used to manage for the potentially conflicting objectives of conserving biodiversity and improving fisheries. The fisheries and conservation benefits of alternative reserve designs would ideally be assessed using dynamic models, which consider spillover of fish and larvae to fished areas, and the displacement of fishers to unprotected sites. In practice, however, decisions about the location of marine reserves generally rely on cheaper and faster static models. Static models analyze only spatial patterns in habitats, and typically assume fisheries profits are reduced by the amount that was generated in areas designated as reserves. To help determine the benefits of developing dynamic fisheries models, we assessed how well static models estimate costs of reserve systems to fisheries and how outcomes from reserves designed using either static or dynamic models differ. We tested these questions in two case studies, the network of marine protected areas in southern California, USA and the proposed Tun Mustapha Marine Park in Malaysia. Static models could either under or over-estimate the cost of reserve plans to fisheries, depending on the relative importance of fisher movement and larval dispersal dynamics. Despite the inaccuracy of static models for estimating costs, reserves designed using static models were similar to those designed with dynamic models if fisheries were well managed; or larval dispersal networks were simple. If larval networks were complex or there was overfishing, dynamic models generated substantially different reserve networks from static models, which improved conservation outcomes by up to 10{\%} and fishing profits by up 20{\%}. The time-scale of management was also important, because only dynamic models accounted for larval dispersal, so could find reserves that maximized the long-term benefits of larval spillover. Our case studies provide quantitative support for the assertion that static models can be useful for planning marine reserves for short-term objectives in well managed fisheries, but are not reliable for evaluating the relative costs of reserves to fisheries.},

However, since lack of realism is inherent to all experimental science, if lack of realism invalidates microcosm models of ecological processes, then such lack of realism must either also invalidate much of the rest of experimental ecology or its force with respect to microcosm studies must derive from some other limitation of microcosm apparatus. We believe that the logic of the microcosm program for ecological research has been misunderstood. Here, we respond to the criticism that microcosm studies play at most a heuristic role in ecology with a new account of scientific experimentation developed specifically with ecology and other environmental sciences in mind. Central to our account are the concepts of model-based reasoning and analogical inference. We find that microcosm studies are sound when they serve as models for nature and when certain properties, referred to as the essential properties, are in positive analogy. By extension, our account also justifies numerous other kinds of ecological experimentation. These results are important because reliable causal accounts of ecological processes are necessary for sound application of ecological theory to conservation and environmental science. A severe sensitivity to reliable representation of causes is the chief virtue of the microcosm approach.},

americana. Elasmobranch abundance was sampled in 3 atoll macrohabitats (deep lagoon, ocean reef,
shallow lagoon) using standardized longlines. Total elasmobranch abundance did not change from
year to year, but was significantly higher inside the lagoon than on the ocean reef outside the atoll.
G. cirratum dominated both shallow and deep lagoon catches, with smaller individuals more prevalent
in the shallow lagoon. C. perezi of all size classes dominated the ocean reef catches, but small
juveniles of this species were also common in the deep lagoon. This species rarely utilized the shallow
lagoon. A wide range of sizes of C. perezi and G. cirratum occupy Glover's Reef in spring and
summer, with males maturing at 150 to 170 cm and 185 to 200 cm total length, respectively. The sex
ratios of these species did not deviate from unity. A large juvenile Gal{\{}{\'{a}}{\}}pagos shark, C. galapagensis,
was collected on the ocean reef, extending the range of this species into the Western Caribbean.
Opportunistic surveys of fish markets on the Belize mainland revealed that inshore areas are utilized
by early life-stages of sharks from the families Carcharhinidae (C. limbatus, N. brevirostris, Rhizoprionodon
porosus) and Sphyrnidae (Sphyrna tiburo, S. lewini, S. mokarran).},

Like any analysis technique, the accuracy of the results is as good as the data available, but the additional challenge is that the data need to characterize an entire ecosystem's flows and storages. Thus, data requirements are substantial. As a result, there have, in fact, not been a significant number of network models constructed and development of the network analysis methodology has progressed largely within the purview of a few established models. In this paper, we outline the steps for one approach to construct network models. Lastly, we also provide a brief overview of the algorithmic methods used to construct food web typologies when empirical data are not available. It is our aim that such an effort aids other researchers to consider the construction of such models as well as encourages further refinement of this procedure.},

abstract = {The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a well-known species all over the world and occurs in both wild and domestic forms. European rabbits are present in most of Europe, North Africa, parts of South America, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in more than 800 islands, where they occupy a huge variety of ecosystems (Thompson and King 1994). Its domestic counterpart exhibits a remarkable variety of breeds showing variation in colour, size and fertility. Domestic breeds are kept and raised globally for meat, wool and fur, and also as increasing popular pets. However, for most of its history, the European rabbit was confined to the Iberian Peninsula where the species is supposed to have emerged in the mid-Pleistocene. We know this from the analysis of the fossil record that in addition, places also in the Iberian Peninsula the emergence of genus Oryctolagus (Lopez-Martinez 2008, this book). The subsequent geographical expansion and successful colonization of multiple territories is as recent as historical times and has been mostly human-mediated. This expansion eventually ended in a domestication process that is unique to Western Europe.},

abstract = {The pervasive influence of human induced global environmental change affects biodiversity across the globe, and there is great uncertainty as to how the biosphere will react on short and longer time scales. To adapt to what the future holds and to manage the impacts of global change, scientists need to predict the expected effects with some confidence and communicate these predictions to policy makers. However, recent reviews found that we currently lack a clear understanding of how predictable ecology is, with views seeing it as mostly unpredictable to potentially predictable, at least over short time frames. However, in applied, ecology-related fields predictions are more commonly formulated and reported, as well as evaluated in hindsight, potentially allowing one to define baselines of predictive proficiency in these fields. We searched the literature for representative case studies in these fields and collected information about modeling approaches, target variables of prediction, predictive proficiency achieved, as well as the availability of data to parameterize predictive models. We find that some fields such as epidemiology achieve high predictive proficiency, but even in the more predictive fields proficiency is evaluated in different ways. Both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are used in most fields, but differences are often small, with no clear superiority of one approach over the other. Data availability is limiting in most fields, with long-term studies being rare and detailed data for parameterizing mechanistic models being in short supply. We suggest that ecologists adopt a more rigorous approach to report and assess predictive proficiency, and embrace the challenges of real world decision making to strengthen the practice of prediction in ecology.},

The closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability of colonisation of an empty reserve by an occupied reserve, thus increasing population viability. However, the closer the networks are placed together, the higher the probability that a catastrophe will cause extinction of the species in both reserves, thus decreasing population viability. Using a simple discrete-time Markov chain model for the presence or absence of the species in each reserve we determine the distance between the two reserves which provides the optimal trade-off between these processes, resulting in maximum viability of the species. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Stochastic demographic models were developed for Carcharhinus obscurus and C. plumbeus populations off the west coast of Australia by resampling the input parameters for life tables from empirical biological data collected from commercial target fisheries and fishery-independent surveys. The models were used to examine the effects of multiple scenarios of age-specific survival, derived from the fishing mortality rates estimated from a tagging study on sharks and indirect estimates of natural mortality. In the absence of fishing, median estimates of the rates of intrinsic population increase (r) were 0.025 for both species. Inclusion of the age-specific fishing mortality rates estimated for C. obscurus recruits born in 1994 and 1995 resulted in the median estimates of r declining to 0.007 and 0.012, respectively, suggesting that recent harvest levels of mainly neonates by the target fishery were probably sustainable. However, the model also suggested that the population was more susceptible to exploitation of older sharks than was previously believed. The C. plumbeus model indicated that fishing mortality between 2001 and 2004 was probably unsustainable. The increasingly negative trend in median r estimates (from --0.032 to --0.049), and the population's apparently limited capacity for density-dependent compensation through changes in fecundity, somatic growth and longevity, suggests that management intervention is necessary to prevent continued stock depletion.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and {\textgreater}16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5-261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

abstract = {Summary. Relative tendencies toward dispersal or philopatry in a marked population of alpine mammals, the pika (Ochotona princeps),were investigated over a 3-year period in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Home range size, distances between centers of activity of dyads, and weighted overlaps of home ranges of dyads were used to define space use patterns. Disappearance and establishment of individuals reflected the temporal component of space use. Social relationships among conspecifics were defined by agonistic and affiliative behaviors. Home ranges of resident adult males and fe- males were of equal size on talus, the obligate habitat of pikas. Adjacent home ranges were normally occupied by members of the opposite sex, and this spacing apparently results from the balance of agonistic and affiliative behaviors exhibited by nearest-neighbor heterosexual pairs. Most juveniles were philopatric. Throughout the summer they remained on their natal home range where they were involved in both agonistic and affiliative behaviors with their mother and putative father. Most animals that established residency were juveniles, and of these almost all settled within 50 m of their natal home range center. This pattern was independent of population density. Immigrants were met with extreme aggression by resident adults that was not balanced by affiliative behaviors. Few immigrants of either sex successfully established on the study area. Adults occasionally changed home ranges, probably to enhance their chances of mating. Intense aggression directed at unfamiliar animals coupled with the acceptance of spatial overlap of related young throughout the summer apparently promote philopatty in pikas. Philopatric settlement in pikas may lead to incestuous matings and contribute to their low intrapopulation genetic variability.},

This certainly ignited my interests in complexity and dynamical systems. I book marked a few references and particurarily interesting passages:

abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.},

abstract = {In polygynous mating systems, males often increase their fecundity via aggressive defense of mates and/or resources necessary for successful mating. Here we show that both male and female reproductive behavior during the breeding season (June--August) affect female fecundity, a vital rate that is an important determinant of population growth rate and viability. By using 4 years of data on behavior and demography of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), we found that male behavior and spatial dynamics---aggression and territory size---are significantly related to female fecundity. Higher rates of male aggression and larger territory sizes were associated with lower estimates of female fecundity within the same year. Female aggression was significantly and positively related to fecundity both within the same year as the behavior was measured and in the following year. These results indicate that while male aggression and defense of territories may increase male fecundity, such interactions may cause a reduction in the overall population growth rate by lowering female fecundity. Females may attempt to offset male-related reductions in female fecundity by increasing their own aggression--- perhaps to defend pups from incidental injury or mortality. Thus in polygynous mating systems, male aggression may increase male fitness at the cost of female fitness and overall population viability.},

abstract = {In this article we further develop the theory of adaptive dynamics of function-valued traits. Previous work has concentrated on models for which invasion fitness can be written as an integral in which the integrand for each argument value is a function of the strategy value at that argument value only. For this type of models of direct effect, singular strategies can be found using the calculus of variations, with singular strategies needing to satisfy Euler's equation with environmental feedback. In a broader, more mechanistically oriented class of models, the function-valued strategy affects a process described by differential equations, and fitness can be expressed as an integral in which the integrand for each argument value depends both on the strategy and on process variables at that argument value. In general, the calculus of variations cannot help analyzing this much broader class of models. Here we explain how to find singular strategies in this class of process-mediated models using optimal control theory. In particular, we show that singular strategies need to satisfy Pontryagin's maximum principle with environmental feedback. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by studying the evolution of strategies determining seasonal flowering schedules.},

Process-mediated models- function-valued strategy affects a process of ODEs

Pontryagin's maximum principle

Two examples:
1) seasonal flowering where plants are limited by where they can allowcate flower production - a cost of plasticity
2)
3) split allocation betweeen leaves and flowers- resource allocation, not flowering intensity, is the trait under natural selection


Summary:
This paper extends the theory of function-valued AD of Dieckmann et al 2006 and Pavinen et al 2006 by using optimal control theory to find singular strategies. Optimal control theory is needed, instead of calculus of variations, when the function-valued strategy affects a system of ODEs that then feedbacks to the invasion fitness of the mutant. They term these models as process-mediated models, as they are more mechanistic. We now look at equation 10. Singular strategies in these process-mediated models must satisfy Pontryagin's maximum principle. The principle essentially says that if {\$}s(a){\$} is a optimal control funciton that maximizes that invader fitness in eq. 10, then there exists a nonzero vector {\$}\backslashlambda(a){\$} such that {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}d{\}}{\{}da{\}} \backslashlambda{\_}i(a){\$} is equal to a Hamiltonian function. ...

Application
This paper extends the seasonal flowering models of Diekman et al 2006. There first extension includes a cost of plasticty, in the form of including both {\$}s(a){\$} and {\$}s'(a){\$} in the calculation of invader fitness. This allows for a realistic cost to changing strategy too rapidly. As the cost of plasticity increases, the singular strategy of flowering schedule peaks at the same time as the no cost scenarion, but with a lower and more broad peak. 

In the next two extensions, they examine a tradeoff between flowering and resource use. In these scenarios optimal control theory is needed to find singular strategies. They specifically examine the evolution of resource allocation which is a function of the flowering schedule. Here an increase in {\$}gamma{\$}, which decreases flower production, tends to evolve a resource-allocation strategy that is more evenly dispersed throughout the season. When flower production is high (low {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}), plants allocate more resources to flowering earlier. Similar to Dieckmann et al 2006, evolutionary branching can occur here as well

In the last extension, they look at an explicit tradeoff between leaf growth and flower production. The singular strategies obtained given the particular model setup has plants that prefer to flower later in the season.},

Here we describe the use of a novel technology, an animal-borne acoustic proximity receiver that records close-spatial associations between free-ranging fish by detection of acoustic signals emitted from transmitters on other individuals. Validation trials, held within enclosures in the natural environment, on juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris fitted with external receivers and transmitters, showed receivers logged interactions between individuals regularly when sharks were within 4 m (,4 body lengths) of each other, but rarely when at 10 m distance. A field trial lasting 17 days with 5 juvenile lemon sharks implanted with proximity receivers showed one receiver successfully recorded association data, demonstrating this shark associated with 9 other juvenile lemon sharks on 128 occasions. This study describes the use of acoustic underwater proximity receivers to quantify interactions among wild sharks, setting the scene for new advances in understanding the social behaviours of marine animals.},

abstract = {We present a high-quality ({\textgreater}100× depth) Illumina genome sequence of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior, a model species for symbiosis and reproductive conflict studies. We compare this genome with three previously sequenced genomes of ants from different subfamilies and focus our analyses on aspects of the genome likely to be associated with known evolutionary changes. The first is the specialized fungal diet of A. echinatior, where we find gene loss in the ant's arginine synthesis pathway, loss of detoxification genes, and expansion of a group of peptidase proteins. One of these is a unique ant-derived contribution to the fecal fluid, which otherwise consists of "garden manuring" fungal enzymes that are unaffected by ant digestion. The second is multiple mating of queens and ejaculate competition, which may be associated with a greatly expanded nardilysin-like peptidase gene family. The third is sex determination, where we could identify only a single homolog of the feminizer gene. As other ants and the honeybee have duplications of this gene, we hypothesize that this may partly explain the frequent production of diploid male larvae in A. echinatior. The fourth is the evolution of eusociality, where we find a highly conserved ant-specific profile of neuropeptide genes that may be related to caste determination. These first analyses of the A. echinatior genome indicate that considerable genetic changes are likely to have accompanied the transition from hunter-gathering to agricultural food production 50 million years ago, and the transition from single to multiple queen mating 10 million years ago.},

They also found that the evolution of eusociality where a highly conserved set of neuropeptide genes may play a role. With the genomic data the authors are also able to put a timeline of these evolutionary changes. I thought this paper was interesting, because of the evolutionary questions it was trying to address, but I did find it difficult to follow in parts. 
The authors use Illimina HiSeq platform to get 60.7Gb of raw reads and de nova assembly generatred a 300 Mb genome sequence for the leaf cutter ant species. They sequenced both DNA and RNA to answer their various questions. Simply because of amount of expression that RNA information tells you? Compared to the other study, these authors use read lengths that are several 100 or thousand base pairs long. I am guessing this is because this is whole genome DNA instead of that from transcriptomes. Specifically, this genome DNA may be more complicated with lots of similar sequences of base pairs, so longer read lengths are needed. I am not sure how I would change this study if I was working on it today. Maybe I'll know in the next two weeks!

In the eastern Pacific warm pool at the center of the ETP, temporal variability at any scale is relatively low. ENSO warm (El Ni{\~{n}}o) and cold (La Ni{\~{n}}a) events have had a variety of effects on marine populations and ecosystems, but these effects are generally followed by recovery within a few years. El Ni{\~{n}}o effects such as mortality or reproductive failure are most severe on pop- ulations dependent on local feeding or breeding grounds in coastal waters or around islands. Decadal variability has also caused change in populations and ecosystems. Most of these effects have been observed in the California Current, Gulf of Alaska, and other well studied regions of the Pacific. The 1976–1977 phase change or ‘regime shift' is the most well known case of decadal variability. It affected the physical environment throughout the Pacific Ocean and had major effects on North Pacific ecosystems. No regime shift has been detected in the ETP since 1977. However, ENSO vari- ability continues, an unusually persistent warming prevailed in the early 1990s and the thermocline has shoaled in the ETP warm pool area since 1980. Potential population effects on dolphin stocks are discussed. Interaction of environmental changes with other factors, such as fishery stress or mortality, may also induce population effects.},

We show that, while population-level responses of laying date and clutch size to temperature were similar in the two populations, between-individual variation in plasticity differed markedly. Both populations showed significant variation in phenotypic plasticity (IxE) for laying date, but IxE was significantly higher in HV than in WW. There were no significant genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE) for laying date, yet differences in GxE were marginally nonsignificant between HV and WW. For clutch size, we only found significant IxE and GxE in WW but no significant difference between populations. From a multivariate perspective, plasticity in laying date was not correlated with plasticity in clutch size in either population.

abstract = {Migration is a striking behavioral strategy by which many animals enhance resource acquisition while reducing predation risk. Historically, the demographic benefits of such movements made migration common, but in many taxa the phenomenon is considered globally threatened. Here we describe a long-term decline in the productivity of elk (Cervus elaphus) that migrate through intact wilderness areas to protected summer ranges inside Yellowstone National Park, USA. We attribute this decline to a long-term reduction in the demographic benefits that ungulates typically gain from migration. Among migratory elk, we observed a 21-year, 70{\%} reduction in recruitment and a 4-year, 19{\%} depression in their pregnancy rate largely caused by infrequent reproduction of females that were young or lactating. In contrast, among resident elk, we have recently observed increasing recruitment and a high rate of pregnancy. Landscape-level changes in habitat quality and predation appear to be responsible for the declining productivity of Yellowstone migrants. From 1989 to 2009, migratory elk experienced an increasing rate and shorter duration of green-up coincident with warmer spring-summer temperatures and reduced spring precipitation, also consistent with observations of an unusually severe drought in the region. Migrants are also now exposed to four times as many grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) as resident elk. Both of these restored predators consume migratory elk calves at high rates in the Yellowstone wilderness but are maintained at low densities via lethal management and human disturbance in the year-round habitats of resident elk. Our findings suggest that large-carnivore recovery and drought, operating simultaneously along an elevation gradient, have disproportionately influenced the demography of migratory elk. Many migratory animals travel large geographic distances between their seasonal ranges. Changes in land use and climate that disparately influence such seasonal ranges may alter the ecological basis of migratory behavior, representing an important challenge for, and a powerful lens into, the ecology and conservation of migratory taxa.},

abstract = {Speciation generally involves a three-step process--range expansion, range fragmentation and the development of reproductive isolation between spatially separated populations. Speciation relies on cycling through these three steps and each may limit the rate at which new species form. We estimate phylogenetic relationships among all Himalayan songbirds to ask whether the development of reproductive isolation and ecological competition, both factors that limit range expansions, set an ultimate limit on speciation. Based on a phylogeny for all 358 species distributed along the eastern elevational gradient, here we show that body size and shape differences evolved early in the radiation, with the elevational band occupied by a species evolving later. These results are consistent with competition for niche space limiting species accumulation. Even the elevation dimension seems to be approaching ecological saturation, because the closest relatives both inside the assemblage and elsewhere in the Himalayas are on average separated by more than five million years, which is longer than it generally takes for reproductive isolation to be completed; also, elevational distributions are well explained by resource availability, notably the abundance of arthropods, and not by differences in diversification rates in different elevational zones. Our results imply that speciation rate is ultimately set by niche filling (that is, ecological competition for resources), rather than by the rate of acquisition of reproductive isolation.},

In examining food chains, it is possible to make predictions on the population size or body size of species in each level of the food chain using energy and scaling calculations. Selective forces can lead to the shortening of food chains (e.g. whales on plankton). Body size capabilities also affects the length of a food chain. Terrestrial systems are likely so diverse because of the huge number of plant species. Food chains are, of course, in fact food webs. Invasive species may have different levels of success depending on how stable the community already is (i.e. can invade when the system is weak). Diversity may be limited by primary productivity of the system or the number of niches. It is difficult to figure out how much difference must exist for two similar species to conexist. The mosaic nature of the environment is another way of stating that species colonize areas with different local diversity and different trophic structures. This may also imply that because in differences in trophic position and body size, large and small species may evolve differently. },

abstract = {The length of the snow-free season has a significant influence on reproduction and growth in northern alpine environments, and these life history traits may provide sensitive indicators of the responses of organisms to climate change. We examined growth rates and timing of parturition of collared pikas (Ochotona collaris) from 1995-2002 in the Ruby Range, Yukon Territory, Canada. Growth rates were best described using a Gompertz model, in which the asymptotic mass, determined from the average male and female weights, was 157 g, the growth rate constant (K) was 0.0557, and the age at inflection (I) was 18.12 days, for a birth weight of 10 g. The maximum growth rate for North American pikas (O. collaris and O. princeps) increased with latitude, with maximum growth rates being approximately one-third greater in northern populations where the snow-free season is less than three months long. The mean parturition date varied significantly among years from 3 June to 3 July, and delayed parturition was correlated with indices of high snow accumulation and, to a lesser extent, late spring snowmelt. However, parturition date did not significantly affect the subsequent over-winter survival of juveniles in this population, suggesting that pikas are able to adjust to seasonal uncertainty associated with highly variable spring conditions.},

These indices can, however, be misleading because changes over time in catch rates can occur because of factors other than changes in abundance. Catch-effort standardization is used to attempt to remove the impact of these factors. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the methods for standardizing catch and effort data. It outlines the major estimation approaches being applied, the methods for dealing with zero observations, how to identify and select appropriate explanatory variables, and how standardized catch rate data can be used when conducting stock assessments.},

-dealing with zero catches (can happen for many reasons and all have different solutions)
--the delta approach deals with this problem explicitly 
-a number of distributions can handle zero values
-however, if processes that lead to zero catches are not the same as non-zero catches, an inflated zero catch model is needed (simply a peace wise description of a given distribution)- versions exist of this for the Poisson and negative binomial
        
Delta approaches:
-essentially models probability of getting a zero catch in the first place and then the catch rate given the catch is in fact non zero (two combined sub models)
--can utilize a number of distributions: log normal, gamma, Poisson, negative binomial
        
{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}
-include explanatory variables only if they may impact catch ability

l=likelihood function
p=number of parameters
n= number of observations
-typically you also need to apply additional criteria (i.e. only if model reduces deviance- R{\^{}}2 is increased- by some given percentage)- this overcomes errors that occur with huge data sets

-model catch with poisson and use fishing effort as an offset or as an explanatory variable
-avoid raising covariates to higher powers if you can help it

-included other species in model may remove time trends in catch rate

A total of 56 young sharks from 3 cohorts (2003, 2004, 2005) were fitted with acoustic tags and monitored for up to 460 d. Sharks did not remain within the estuary continuously, but on average approximately one- third were present at any one time from each cohort. Salinity and freshwater inflow showed greatest influence on shark distribution, with temperature appearing to play a limited role. Although individ- uals occurred in salinities from 0.1 to 34, electivity analysis indicated that they generally avoided areas with salinity {\textless}7 and had an affinity for areas with salinities from 7 to at least 20. There were significant relationships between the mean location of a cohort within the estuary and salinity, with sharks occurring further up river when the river was more saline. These relationships were more pronounced for the youngest sharks, and strength of the relationship decreased with age. Since bull sharks are euryhaline, these results suggest that they may select environmental conditions via move- ment, possibly to reduce energetic costs associated with osmoregulation.},

abstract = {Whether interspecific hybridization is important as a mechanism that generates biological diversity is a matter of controversy. Whereas some authors focus on the potential of hybridization as a source of genetic variation, functional novelty and new species, others argue against any important role, because reduced fitness would typically render hybrids an evolutionary dead end. By drawing on recent developments in the genetics and ecology of hybridization and on principles of ecological speciation theory, I develop a concept that reconciles these views and adds a new twist to this debate. Because hybridization is common when populations invade new environments and potentially elevates rates of response to selection, it predisposes colonizing populations to rapid adaptive diversification under disruptive or divergent selection. I discuss predictions and suggest tests of this hybrid swarm theory of adaptive radiation and review published molecular phylogenies of adaptive radiations in light of the theory.},

This study investigates the biology of tiger sharks in the shallow seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Western Australia.

The overall sex ratio was biased towards females (1.8 : 1), but the sex ratio of mature animals ({\textgreater} 300 cm TL) did not differ from 1 : 1. Contrary to previous accounts, tiger sharks were caught more often in all habitats during daylight hours than at night. Tiger shark catch rates were highly correlated with water temperature and were highest when water temperatures were above 19 C. The seasonal abundance of tiger sharks is correlated to both water temperature and the occurrence of their main prey: sea snakes and dugongs, Dugong dugon. Stomach contents analysis indicated that sea turtles and smaller elasmobranchs were also common prey. The importance of major seagrass grazers (dugongs and green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas) in the diet of tiger sharks suggests the possibility that these sharks are keystone predators in this ecosystem.},

In this study, we provide guidance in using expert knowledge in a transparent and credible manner to inform ecological models and ultimately natural resource and conservation decision-making. We illustrate the decisions faced when considering the use of expert knowledge in a model with the help of two real ecological case studies. These examples are explored further to examine the impact of expert knowledge through ‘priors' in Bayesian modeling and specifically how to minimize potential bias. Finally, we make recommendations on the use of expert opinion in ecology.

Previous studies had noted that less than 10{\%} of juveniles emerged from second litters. Apparently females are capable of weaning second litters, but only if first litters are lost.

One year after a severe tropical cyclone, corals inside reserves had sevenfold lower levels of disease than those in non-reserves. Similarly, disease prevalence was threefold lower on reserve reefs following chronic exposure to terrestrial run-off from a degraded river catchment, when exposure duration was below the long-term site average. Examination of 35 predictor variables indicated that lower levels of derelict fishing line and injured corals inside reserves were correlated with lower levels of coral disease in both case studies, signifying that successful disease mitigation occurs when activities that damage reefs are restricted. Conversely, reserves were ineffective in moderating disease when sites were exposed to higher than average levels of run-off, demonstrating that reductions in water quality undermine resilience afforded by reserve protection. In addition to implementing protected areas, we highlight that disease management efforts should also target improving water quality and limiting anthropogenic activities that cause injury.},

abstract = {Despite advances in marine conservation research, policy, and management, human activities continue to negatively affect marine species, habitats, and ecosystems, and the people who rely on them for needed resources. This begs the question: What is preventing us from being more effective in conserving marine species, habitats, and ecosystems? Answering this requires us to identify gaps in marine conservation efforts and develop a consensus on how best to target our efforts. One way to do this is to conduct research prioritization exercises. The questions discussed here were identified during a series of workshops designed to establish a list of important questions that need to be answered to advance marine conservation. We deemed these particular questions to be in a separate class than those considered in the associated paper “Seventy-One Important Questions for the Conservation of Marine Biodiversity” (Parsons et al. 2014). These questions were put into a separate category because they were identified as areas of ecological, social, and economic research that include external drivers or required sizable paradigm shifts to address. Here we describe and discuss these "Kraken in the aquarium" questions—the marine equivalent of “the elephant in the room” questions—in four sections: human nature, meeting our responsibilities, entrenched interests, and corporate driven policy. Within each section, we address multiple questions by identifying the issues and offering examples of ways forward where possible. This paper is intended to start a dialogue about these difficult questions that loom over marine conservation research and management. It is becoming increasingly important that the conservation practitioner community engages in these discussions and develops solutions in order for our work to be fully effective.},

abstract = {To forecast marine disease outbreaks as oceans warm requires new environmental surveillance tools. We describe an iterative process for developing these tools that combines research, development and deployment for suitable systems. The first step is to identify candidate host–pathogen systems. The 24 candidate systems we identified include sponges, corals, oysters, crustaceans, sea stars, fishes and sea grasses (among others). To illustrate the other steps, we present a case study of epizootic shell disease (ESD) in the American lobster. Increasing prevalence of ESD is a contributing factor to lobster fishery collapse in southern New England (SNE), raising concerns that disease prevalence will increase in the northern Gulf of Maine under climate change. The lowest maximum bottom temperature associated with ESD prevalence in SNE is 12°C. Our seasonal outlook for 2015 and long-term projections show bottom temperatures greater than or equal to 12°C may occur in this and coming years in the coastal bays of Maine. The tools presented will allow managers to target efforts to monitor the effects of ESD on fishery sustainability and will be iteratively refined. The approach and case example highlight that temperature-based surveillance tools can inform research, monitoring and management of emerging and continuing marine disease threats.},

abstract = {Surprisingly little is known about the reproductive behaviour and breeding biology of most shark species, especially in natural populations. Here, we characterize reproductive patterns and use of a natal nursery at Bimini, Bahamas by lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris. We systematically and exhaustively sampled young lemon sharks at Bimini annually from 1995 to 2000 and opportunistically sampled adults over the same period. Out of the 897 young sharks sampled, 119 could be assigned to five sampled mothers using microsatellite genotyping. Reproductive females showed strong philopatry to the nursery, returning to Bimini every two years to give birth. Each of these females may rely entirely on the Bimini nursery for recruitment. The protection of known nursery grounds should therefore figure prominently in conservation efforts for large coastal shark species. The reconstruction of paternal genotypes indicates that litters are sired by multiple males, and females mate with different males nearly every breeding cycle. The ubiquitous polyandry reported here raises the possibility that genetic incompatibility and post-copulatory paternity- biasing mechanisms may operate in viviparous sharks.},

abstract = {Abstract. The structure of 4 populations of a small boreal mammal,the pika(Ochotona princeps), is examined to explore the causal mechanisms of evolution of life-history features of the species. Litter size reflects potential and realized fecundity and is largest at Bodie (low latitude, low altitude), intermediate at Sierra and Colorado(low latitude,high altitude),and smallest at Alberta(high latitude). The age specificity of mortality largely determines the number of sites available for settlement by juveniles, which dictates the feedback to litter size. Populations are stable and habitats continuously saturated at Alberta; mortality of adults is predictable.The Sierra and Colorado sites possess unstable populations. At these sites, snow melt in spring(the harbinger of emergent vegetation and successful weaning)is relatively unpredictable compared to Alberta; adult mortality may be high in years of early or late snowmelt.The unpredictability also selects for asynchronous breeding such that more sites are available in any one year to offspring from certain successfully weaned litters. The habitat at Bodie is temporally and spatially unsaturated. Largely because of poor vagility of pikas, much of the habitat is vacant. Colonization is unable to completely offset extinction of populations on patches of habitat. Here,the selective factor determining litter size is juvenile production and not adult mortality},

We examine the SAD in the context of all possible forms having the same richness (S) and total abundance (N), i.e. the feasible set. We find that feasible sets are dominated by similarly shaped hollow curves, most of which are highly correlated with empirical SADs (most R(2) values {\textgreater} 75{\%}), revealing a strong influence of N and S on the form of the SAD and an a priori explanation for the ubiquitous hollow curve. Empirical SADs are often more hollow and less variable than the majority of the feasible set, revealing exceptional unevenness and relatively low natural variability among ecological communities. We discuss the importance of the feasible set in understanding how general constraints determine observable variation and influence the forms of predicted and empirical patterns.},

abstract = {In marine ecosystems, rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change are associated with concurrent shifts in temperature, circulation, stratification, nutrient input, oxygen content, and ocean acidification, with potentially wide-ranging biological effects. Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.},

abstract = {After placing the study of behavioral syndromes into historical perspective and clarifying some misconceptions about the term, the aim of this chapter is to illustrate some of the important questions that come into focus when viewing animal behavior through "behavioral syndromes lenses." In general, we see two particularly exciting research directions. One of these focuses on trying to understand variation in behavioral syndromes. The other applies the behavioral syndromes approach to topics of interest to behavioral ecologists that have not historically focused on individual variation: For any given behavior, do individuals behave consistently differently from each other? If so, are those differences correlated across contexts? The next major task in studies of behavioral syndromes themselves is to quantify and explain the patterns of variation in behavioral syndromes. As a first step, for example, we would like to know which behaviors tend to occur in clusters and which tend to be independent? When do correlations break down over ontogenetic and evolutionary time? Then, the challenge is to explain those patterns from both a proximate and ultimate perspective- how does selection act on differences in the lability of proximate mechanisms to produce variable correlations? At the same time, we expect that the next major wave of studies on behavioral syndromes will apply these ideas to understand topics of interest to behavioral ecologists, things like mate choice, cooperation, and group living. We described several relatively understudied axes of behavioral variation, for example environmental and social sensitivity, learning, choosiness, cooperativeness, etc, all of which could offer new insights into long-standing questions. Along the way, we highlighted other priorities for research such as consideration of nonbehavioral traits such as physiology and morphology as part of an integrated phenotype and the inclusion of conceptual (e.g., dynamic programming, network theory, and path analysis) and empirical (e.g., genomics) tools. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {1. Autocorrelation and individual heterogeneity are now considered to reflect biological processes rather than simply being a nuisance requiring to be accounted for.Before using parameter estimates that represent autocorrelation and individual heterogeneity to infer biological processes, a statistical evaluation of their precision and accuracy is required to validate their use. 2. Using simulated data, we evaluated accuracy and precision of temporal autocorrelation and individual heterogeneity estimates provided by different statistical models. We compared estimates across different intensity of individual variation and life histories, and sampling effort. We focused on recurrent binary variables because statistical evaluations of models describing binary processes have often been overlooked although several evolutionary and ecological processes are expressed as binary variables (e.g. probability of annual reproduction, plant annual flowering and detection, seasonal migration decision). 3. Our results showed that autocorrelation and individual heterogeneity were generally better esti- mated using a ‘time series' modelling approach, but that a ‘state dependence' modelling approach also provided fair estimates in most cases. The latter method was even more robust when data sets included missing values. Data sets including missing values or consisting of very short times series resulted in important bias in someinstances. 4. Models ignoring either individual heterogeneity or autocorrelation performed poorly, illustrat- ing the fundamental association between these two processes, and demonstrating that the complex structure of autocorrelation and individual heterogeneity patterns is difficult to tackle using simple models. 5. Ourwork'smajor finding is the demonstration that autocorrelation and individual heterogeneity need to be both accounted for to provide reliable estimates even in studies focusing on only one of these processes. Our study also offers a set of practical recommendations for helping researchers modelling these two processes depending on their scientific aims and the structure of their data. Finally, our results illustrate that more research is required for estimating individual heterogeneity when positive temporal autocorrelation is expected because none of the models evaluated provided suitable estimates},

abstract = {Abstract
Concern over declining shark populations has led to an intense interest in their conservation and management. Due to the difficulties involved in managing adult sharks, focus has been placed on young juvenile and neonate age classes that inhabit discrete inshore nursery areas. However, past confusion over what qualifies as a nursery habitat has led to the identification of vast coastal areas as nurseries, making conservation unfeasible. With the establishment of more discerning criteria for nursery area identification such concerns have been somewhat alleviated, but while effort has been put into defining, identifying, mapping, and in some cases protecting nursery areas, little attention has been paid to the practical value of nurseries for the recovery of exploited shark pop- ulations. Often neonate and young juveniles are considered the most critical age classes in terms of population stability/recovery, but evidence is mount- ing that suggests life stages outside the nursery may be more important in this regard. While nursery area protection should remain a component in shark management strategies it will be critical to link early life stage conservation with management strategies that encompass older individuals residing outside nurseries if effective management is to be achieved.},

abstract = {It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

abstract = {Despite extensive research on the effects of habitat fragmentation, the ecological mechanisms underlying colonization and extinction processes are poorly known, but knowledge of these mechanisms is essential to understanding the distribution and persistence of populations in fragmented habitats. We examined these mechanisms through multiseason occupancy models that elucidated patch-occupancy dynamics of Middle Spotted Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos medius) in northwestern Spain. The number of occupied patches was relatively stable from 2000 to 2010 (15-24{\%} of 101 patches occupied every year) because extinction was balanced by recolonization. Larger and higher quality patches (i.e., higher density of oaks {\textgreater}37 cm dbh [diameter at breast height]) were more likely to be occupied. Habitat quality (i.e., density of large oaks) explained more variation in patch colonization and extinction than did patch size and connectivity, which were both weakly associated with probabilities of turnover. Patches of higher quality were more likely to be colonized than patches of lower quality. Populations in high-quality patches were less likely to become extinct. In addition, extinction in a patch was strongly associated with local population size but not with patch size, which means the latter may not be a good surrogate of population size in assessments of extinction probability. Our results suggest that habitat quality may be a primary driver of patch-occupancy dynamics and may increase the accuracy of models of population survival. We encourage comparisons of competing models that assess occupancy, colonization, and extinction probabilities in a single analytical framework (e.g., dynamic occupancy models) so as to shed light on the association of habitat quality and patch geometry with colonization and extinction processes in different settings and species.},

Analysis of a spatially explicit harvesting model, however, shows that no-take marine reserves are always part of an optimal harvest designed to maximize yield. The optimal harvest generates a spatial source–sink structure with source populations placed in reserves. The sizes and locations of the optimal reserves depend on a dimensionless length parameter. For small values of this parameter, the maximum yield is obtained by placing a large reserve in the centre of the habitat. For large values of this parameter, the optimal harvesting strategy is a spatial ‘chattering control' with infinite sequences of reserves alternating with areas of intense fishing. Such a chattering strategy would be impossible to actually implement, but in these cases an approximate yet practicable policy, utilizing a small number of reserves, can be constructed.},

abstract = {Abstract: A population of young blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) was monitored over three years to determine their mortality rates using a series of acoustic listening stations. Based on these data it was possible to use several mortality estimators, including indirect life history based methods and direct methods such as the Kaplan-Meier and SURVIV methods, to estimate natural, fishing, and total mortality. Kaplan-Meier (61--91{\%}) and SURVIV (62--92{\%}) methods provided nearly identical total mortality rates during the first six months of life. This agreement suggests that these estimates are accurate for this population. All natural and fishing mortality occurred within the first 15 weeks of the study. This suggests that young sharks are most vulnerable to all types of mortality during this period. Sharks that survived beyond the first 15 weeks successfully left the nursery and were presumed to have migrated southward during fall months. These results provide critical information concerning the early life history of sharks and the importance of nursery areas to the survival of young animals.},

Warm- water periods of comparable magnitude were observed in 1957-59 and 1982-84; this most recent event may in fact be the strongest of the three. Biological evidence supporting the impact of this phenomenon was noted in a northern latitudinal shift in the range of a number of eastern tropical Pacific fishes into the warni-temper- ate waters of southern California. Families of fishes rep- resented include Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Elopidae, Albulidae, Ophichthidae, Clupeidae, Synodontidae, Fistulariidae, Scorpaenidae, Triglidae, Serranidae, Apogo- nidae, Carangidae, Lobotidae, Mulbdae, Chaetodontidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Sphyraenidae, Polyne- midae, Labridae, Scaridae, Blenniidae, Callionymidae, Gobiidae, Trichiuridae, Bothidae, Tetraodontidae, and Diodontidae.

Several species taken had not been reported since the Pacific Railroad Survey of the 1850s or the early 1900s (e.g., threebanded butterflyfish and longtail goby). Addtionally, several species heretofore known from single or a few records were taken on multiple occasions and in some numbers. Differences between the 1997-98 and previ- ous El Niiio events and a measure of the intensity of this event are discussed. Changes in the ichthyofauna of California during the most recent El Niiio were perhaps the most dramatic of the twentieth century.},

abstract = {The timing of biological events (phenology) is an important aspect of both a species' life cycle and how it interacts with other species and its environment. Patterns of phenological change have been given much scientific attention, particularly recently in relation to climate change. For pairs of interacting species, if their rates of phenological change differ, then this may lead to asynchrony between them and disruption of their ecological interactions. However it is often difficult to interpret differential rates of phenological change and to predict their ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review theoretical results regarding this topic, with special emphasis on those arising from life history theory, evolutionary game theory and population dynamic models. Much ecological research on phenological change builds upon the concept of match/mismatch, so we start by putting forward a simple but general model that captures essential elements of this concept. We then systematically compare the predictions of this baseline model with expectations from theory in which additional ecological mechanisms and features of species life cycles are taken into account. We discuss the ways in which the fitness consequences of interspecific phenological asynchrony may be weak, strong, or idiosyncratic. We discuss theory showing that synchrony is not necessarily an expected evolutionary outcome, and how population densities are not neces- sarily maximized by adaptation, and the implications of these findings. By bringing together theoretical developments regarding the eco-evolutionary consequences of phenological asynchrony, we provide an overview of available alternative hypotheses for interpreting empirical patterns as well as the starting point for the next generation of theory in this field.},

abstract = {Seasonal variation in infection transmission is a key determinant of epidemic dynamics of acute infections. For measles, the best-understood strongly immunizing directly transmitted childhood infection, the perception is that term-time forcing is the main driver of seasonality in developed countries. The degree to which this holds true across other acute immunizing childhood infections is not clear. Here, we identify seasonal transmission patterns using a unique long-term dataset with weekly incidence of six infections including measles. Data on age{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}incidence allow us to quantify the mean age of infection. Results indicate correspondence between dips in transmission and school holidays for some infections, but there are puzzling discrepancies, despite close correspondence between average age of infection and age of schooling. Theoretical predictions of the relationship between amplitude of seasonality and basic reproductive rate of infections that should result from term-time forcing are also not upheld. We conclude that where yearly trajectories of susceptible numbers are perturbed, e.g. via waning of immunity, seasonality is unlikely to be entirely driven by term-time forcing. For the three bacterial infections, pertussis, scarlet fever and diphtheria, there is additionally a strong increase in transmission during the late summer before the end of school vacations. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2009 The Royal Society},

abstract = {Estimating temporal trends in spatially structured populations has a critical role to play in understanding regional changes in biological populations and developing management strategies. Designing effective monitoring programmes to estimate these trends requires important decisions to be made about how to allocate sampling effort among spatial replicates (i.e. number of sites) and temporal replicates (i.e. how often to survey) to minimise uncertainty in trend estimates. In particular, the optimal mix of spatial and temporal replicates is likely to depend upon the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics. Although there has been considerable interest in the ecological literature on understanding spatial and temporal correlations in species' population dynamics, little attention has been paid to its consequences for monitoring design. We address this issue using model-based survey design to identify the optimal allocation of sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates for estimating population trends under different levels of spatial and temporal correlation. Based on linear trends, we show that how we should allocate sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates depends crucially on the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics, environmental variation, observation error and the spatial variation in temporal trends. When spatial correlation is low and temporal correlation is high, the best option is likely to be to sample many sites infrequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are high. When spatial correlation is high and temporal correlation is low, the best option is likely to be to sample few sites frequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are low. When abundances are spatially independent, it is always preferable to maximise spatial replication. This provides important insights into how spatio-temporal monitoring programmes should be designed to estimate temporal trends in spatially structured populations.},

abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, an area almost the size of Japan, has a new network of no-take areas that significantly improves the protection of biodiversity. The new marine park zoning implements, in a quantitative manner, many of the theoretical design principles discussed in the literature. For example, the new network of no-take areas has at least 20{\%} protection per "bioregion," minimum levels of protection for all known habitats and special or unique features, and minimum sizes for no-take areas of at least 10 or 20 km across at the smallest diameter. Overall, more than 33{\%} of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is now in no-take areas (previously 4.5{\%}). The steps taken leading to this outcome were to clarify to the interested public why the existing level of protection was inadequate; detail the conservation objectives of establishing new no-take areas; work with relevant and independent experts to define, and contribute to, the best scientific process to deliver on the objectives; describe the biodiversity (e.g., map bioregions); define operational principles needed to achieve the objectives; invite community input on all of the above; gather and layer the data gathered in round-table discussions; report the degree of achievement of principles for various options of no-take areas; and determine how to address negative impacts. Some of the key success factors in this case have global relevance and include focusing initial communication on the problem to be addressed; applying the precautionary principle; using independent experts; facilitating input to decision making; conducting extensive and participatory consultation; having an existing marine park that encompassed much of the ecosystem; having legislative power under federal law; developing high-level support; ensuring agency priority and ownership; and being able to address the issue of displaced fishers.},

Here, we explore how reproductive schedule and larval behavior affect how much connectivity fluctuations depress growth. We combine larval dispersal simulations from the Florida Keys with theoretical results to calculate the effect of fluctuations on bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus). We find that fluctuations depress growth only slightly (∼2{\%}), but the effect would be much stronger for an organism that spawned only part of the year. Larval behavior can also matter, as vertical migration allows larvae to become entrained in eddies. Eddies synchronize connectivity fluctuations, further decreasing growth. However, here, they also divide the Keys into largely independently fluctuating regions, mitigating the effects of local synchrony. Therefore, in situations where connectivity fluctuations matter, the presence of independently fluctuating regions due to larval behavior may be important.},

These anthropogenic threats must be mitigated as efficiently as possible because both time and money available for mitigation are limited. For example, it is essential to address the type and degree of uncertainties present to derive effective management strategies for managed populations. Decision science provides the tools required to produce effective management strategies that can maximize or minimize the desired objective(s) based on imperfect knowledge, taking into account stochasticity. Of particular importance are questions such as how much of available budgets should be invested in reducing uncertainty and which uncertainties should be reduced. In such instances, decision science can help select efficient environmental management actions that may be subject to stochasticity and imperfect knowledge. Here, we review the use of decision science in environmental management to demonstrate the utility of the decision science framework. Our points are illustrated using examples from the literature. We conclude that collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners is crucial to maximize the benefits of decision science's rational approach to dealing with uncertainty.},

abstract = {Abstract: Deepwater dogsharks (Order Squaliformes) are thought to be particularly vulnerable to overfishing due to life history strategies that place them at the lower end of the shark productivity spectrum. Sharks frequently have relatively low value in multispecies fisheries, where management is usually aimed at maintaining harvest of more valuable and pro- ductive teleosts. This results in low priority being given to data collection for sharks and hampers identification of appro- priate harvest strategies. Here an age-structured model with maximum sustainable harvest rate (UMSY) as leading productivity parameter is systematically applied to show that for certain growth and reproductive schedules that apply to some sharks, the range of possible values that can be taken by UMSY can become very small. The model was applied to 12 Australian dogshark species and was used to show that UMSY is highly constrained under some selectivity schedules. Re- sults were consistent with estimates of the intrinsic rate of growth obtained using a demographic model, suggesting that there may be more certainty about UMSY than expected for many shark species, given uncertainty in recruitment parame- ters. The approach could be used to inform policy for some sharks and may be useful in the development of informative Bayesian priors for assessment models.},

Here, we review theoretical models of rapid evolution in quantitative traits that can shed light on the potential for adaptation to a changing climate. Our focus is on quantitative-genetic models with selection for a moving phenotypic optimum. We point out that there is no one-to-one relationship between the rate of adaptation and population survival, because the former depends on relative fitness and the latter on absolute fitness. Nevertheless, previous estimates that sustainable rates of genetically based change usually do not exceed 0.1 haldanes (i.e., phenotypic standard deviations per generation) are probably correct. Survival can be greatly facilitated by phenotypic plasticity, and heritable variation in plasticity can further speed up genetic evolution. Multivariate selection and genetic correlations are frequently assumed to constrain adaptation, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on the geometric relationship between the fitness landscape and the structure of genetic variation. Similar conclusions hold for adaptation to shifting spatial gradients. Recent models of adaptation in multispecies communities indicate that the potential for rapid evolution is strongly influenced by interspecific competition.},

abstract = {Climate change is apparent as an advancement of spring phenology. However, there is no a priori reason to expect that all components of food chains will shift their phenology at the same rate. This differential shift will lead to mistimed reproduction in many species, including seasonally breeding birds. We argue that climate change induced mistiming in avian reproduction occurs because there is a substantial period between the moment of decision making on when to reproduce and the moment at which selection operates on this decision. Climate change is therefore likely to differentially alter the environment of decision-making and the environment of selection. We discuss the potential consequences of such mistiming, and identify a number of ways in which either individual birds or bird populations potentially can adapt to reproductive mistiming. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity and microevolution are the two primary means by which organisms respond adaptively to local conditions. While these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, their relative magnitudes will influence both the rate of, and ability to sustain, phenotypic responses to climate change. We review accounts of recent phenotypic changes in wild mammal populations with the purpose of critically evaluating the following: (i) whether climate change has been identified as the causal mechanism producing the observed change; (ii) whether the change is adaptive; and (iii) the relative influences of evolution and/or phenotypic plasticity underlying the change. The available data for mammals are scant. We found twelve studies that report changes in phenology, body weight or litter size. In all cases, the observed response was primarily due to plasticity. Only one study (of advancing parturition dates in American red squirrels) provided convincing evidence of contemporary evolution. Subsequently, however, climate change has been shown to not be the causal mechanism underlying this shift. We also summarize studies that have shown evolutionary potential (i.e. the trait is heritable and/or under selection) in traits with putative associations with climate change and discuss future directions that need to be undertaken before a conclusive demonstration of plastic or evolutionary responses to climate change in wild mammals can be made.},

We propose a conceptual framework for including the likely impacts of a changing climate on marine connectivity, and synthesize information on the relationships between changing ocean temperature and acidification, connectivity and conservation tools. Our framework relies on concepts of functional connectivity, which depends on an organism's biological and behavioral responses to the physical environment, and structural connectivity, which describes changes in the physical and spatial structure of the environment that affect connectivity and movement. Our review confirms that ocean climate change likely reduces potential dispersal distance and therefore functional connectivity. Structural connectivity in the ocean will inevitably change with the spatial arrangement of biogenic habitats resulting from disturbance as well as enhanced growth and mortality due to climate change. Climate change will also likely reduce the spatial scale of connectivity, suggesting that we will need more closely spaced protected areas.},

abstract = {Changing patterns of human aggregation are thought to drive annual and multiannual outbreaks of infectious diseases, but the paucity of data about travel behavior and population flux over time has made this idea difficult to test quantitatively. Current measures of human mobility, especially in low-income settings, are often static, relying on approximate travel times, road networks, or cross-sectional surveys. Mobile phone data provide a unique source of information about human travel, but the power of these data to describe epidemiologically relevant changes in population density remains unclear. Here we quantify seasonal travel patterns using mobile phone data from nearly 15 million anonymous subscribers in Kenya. Using a rich data source of rubella incidence, we show that patterns of population travel (fluxes) inferred from mobile phone data are predictive of disease transmission and improve significantly on standard school term time and weather covariates. Further, combining seasonal and spatial data on travel from mobile phone data allows us to characterize seasonal fluctuations in risk across Kenya and produce dynamic importation risk maps for rubella. Mobile phone data therefore offer a valuable previously unidentified source of data for measuring key drivers of seasonal epidemics.},

abstract = {Marine fishes and invertebrates respond to ocean warming through distribution shifts, generally to higher latitudes and deeper waters. Consequently, fisheries should be affected by `tropicalization' of catch (increasing dominance of warm-water species). However, a signature of such climate-change effects on global fisheries catch has so far not been detected. Here we report such an index, the mean temperature of the catch (MTC), that is calculated from the average inferred temperature preference of exploited species weighted by their annual catch. Our results show that, after accounting for the effects of fishing and large-scale oceanographic variability, global MTC increased at a rate of 0.19 degrees Celsius per decade between 1970 and 2006, and non-tropical MTC increased at a rate of 0.23 degrees Celsius per decade. In tropical areas, MTC increased initially because of the reduction in the proportion of subtropical species catches, but subsequently stabilized as scope for further tropicalization of communities became limited. Changes in MTC in 52 large marine ecosystems, covering the majority of the world's coastal and shelf areas, are significantly and positively related to regional changes in sea surface temperature. This study shows that ocean warming has already affected global fisheries in the past four decades, highlighting the immediate need to develop adaptation plans to minimize the effect of such warming on the economy and food security of coastal communities, particularly in tropical regions},

Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies promise to accelerate progress, but sequencing the genomes of hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species remains impractical. Eukaryotic transcriptomes, which are smaller than genomes and biased toward highly expressed genes that tend to be conserved, could potentially provide a rich set of phylogenetic characters. We sampled the transcriptomes of 10 mosquito species by assembling 36-bp sequence reads into phylogenomic data matrices containing hundreds of thousands of orthologous nucleotides from hundreds of genes. Analysis of these data matrices yielded robust phylogenetic inferences, even with data matrices constructed from surprisingly few sequence reads. This approach is more efficient, data-rich, and economical than traditional PCR-based and EST-based methods and provides a scalable strategy for generating phylogenomic data matrices to infer the branches and twigs of the tree of life.},

It predicts how animals ought to distribute themselves within a heterogeneous habitat in order to maximize lifetime fitness. We test the population level consequence of the IFD theory using 40-year worth data on pike (Esox lucius) living in a natural lake divided into two basins. We do so by employing empirically derived density-dependent survival, dispersal and fecundity functions in the estimation of basin-specific density-dependent fitness surfaces. The intersection of the fitness surfaces for the two basins is used for deriving expected spatial distributions of pike. Comparing the derived expected spatial distributions with 50 years data of the actual spatial distribution demonstrated that pike is ideal free distributed within the lake. In general, there was a net migration from the less productive north basin to the more productive south basin. However, a pike density-manipulation experiment imposing shifting pike density gradients between the two basins managed to switch the net migration direction and hence clearly demonstrated that the Windermere pike choose their habitat in an ideal free manner. Demonstration of ideal free habitat selection on an operational field scale like this has never been undertaken before.},

We show how sustainability depends on the fraction of natural larval settlement (FNLS) remaining after reserves are implemented, which in turn depends on reserve configuration and larval dispersal distance. Sustainability requires FNLS to be greater than an empirically determined minimum, Maintaining an adequate value for all species requires either a large, unlikely fraction ({\textgreater} 35{\%}) of coastline in reserves, or reserves that are larger than the mean larval dispersal distance of the target species. FNLS is greater for species dispersing shorter distances, which implies reserves can lead to: (1) changes in community composition and (2) genetic selection fur shorter dispersal distance. Dependence of sustainability on dispersal distance is a new source of uncertainty.},

But which marine habitats should be protected, those areas at greatest risk or those at least risk? We first defined this problem mathematically for 2 alternate conservation objectives. We then analytically solved this problem for both objectives and determined under which conditions each of the different protection strategies was optimal. If the conservation objective was to maximize the chance of having at least 1 healthy site, then the best strategy was protection of the site at lowest risk. On the other hand, if the goal was to maximize the expected number of healthy sites, the optimal strategy was more complex. If protected sites were likely to spend a significant amount of time in a degraded state, then it was best to protect low-risk sites. Alternatively, if most areas were generally healthy then, counterintuitively, it was best to protect sites at higher risk. We applied these strategies to a situation of cyclone disturbance of coral reefs on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. With regard to the risk of cyclone disturbance, the optimal reef to protect differed dramatically, depending on the expected speed of reef recovery of both protected and unprotected reefs. An adequate consideration of risk is fundamental to all conservation actions and can indicate surprising routes to conservation success.},

abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the acquisition of genetic material from non-parental lineages, is known to be important in bacterial evolution. In particular, HGT provides rapid access to genetic innovations, allowing traits such as virulence, antibiotic resistance and xenobiotic metabolism to spread through the human microbiome. Recent anecdotal studies providing snapshots of active gene flow on the human body have highlighted the need to determine the frequency of such recent transfers and the forces that govern these events. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a vast, human-associated network of gene exchange, large enough to directly compare the principal forces shaping HGT. We show that this network of 10,770 unique, recently transferred (more than 99{\%} nucleotide identity) genes found in 2,235 full bacterial genomes, is shaped principally by ecology rather than geography or phylogeny, with most gene exchange occurring between isolates from ecologically similar, but geographically separated, environments. For example, we observe 25-fold more HGT between human-associated bacteria than among ecologically diverse non-human isolates (P = 3.0 × 10(-270)). We show that within the human microbiome this ecological architecture continues across multiple spatial scales, functional classes and ecological niches with transfer further enriched among bacteria that inhabit the same body site, have the same oxygen tolerance or have the same ability to cause disease. This structure offers a window into the molecular traits that define ecological niches, insight that we use to uncover sources of antibiotic resistance and identify genes associated with the pathology of meningitis and other diseases.},
annote = {Science:
It has been unclear at how important horizontal gene transfer is for bacterial evolution, specifically in the human microbiome. This has important implications for work on virulence and antibiotic resistence. This paper found that ecology, as opposed to geography or phylogeny, is more important for horizontal gene transfer in the human microbiome. By ecology, the authors mean the actual ecological similarity in bacteria determine the complex networks of gene exchange. The study looked at one particular example of gene transfer involing meningitis isolates. Though there are a number of genes ({\~{}}24,000) associated with meningitis. This would be untractable to study, but the author's approach would allow researchers to look at the most recently transferred genes (in this case only 13). These types of approaches could also have clinical implications for cases of antibiotic resistence. 






Technology:
In this study, gene information was pulled from a established database. After filtering out some genomes, a total of 2,235 different genomes were used to study horizontal gene transfer. Protein-coding regions were identified by comparing to another database. In their more applied analysis, data on specific antibiotic resistance genes was also used. This paper really used a lot of previous methods and databases instead of creating "new methods".},

abstract = {The coastal ocean environment off California is largely determined by wind-driven coastal upwelling, with an ecosystem that is tightly coupled to seasonality in this upwelling. Three decades of data measured over the California shelf at NOAA buoys are used to describe the seasonal variability of the winds that force upwelling and the response of the coastal ocean in terms of sea temperature. Moreover, seasonal patterns in surface chlorophyll and alongshore currents are determined from one decade of data. In addition to clear seasonality, all these data exhibit distinct spatial and non-seasonal temporal variability in upwelling. Based on alongshore wind stress characteristics in central and north California, three seasons are defined: Upwelling Season (April-June) with strong upwelling-favorable winds and large standard deviation due to frequent reversals; Relaxation Season (July-September) with weak equatorward winds and low variability; and Storm Season (December-February) characterized by weak mean wind stress but large variability. The remaining months are transitional, falling into one or other season in different years. In addition to large-scale latitudinal differences in wind stress, spatial differences are associated with coastal topography - specifically the acceleration of wind downstream of capes. Latitudinal differences in sea surface temperature depend on wind stress, both local and large-scale, but also on surface heating and offshore influences. Intra-annual and inter-annual anomalies in wind and sea surface temperature are associated with variability in coastal winds, large-scale winds, and offshore basin-scale ocean conditions. Satellite chlorophyll concentration shows an optimal window relation with upwelling forcing, allowing maximum concentrations during moderate winds and minimal during poor or strong winds.},

Ideas: review on time and spatial scale of studies in ecology (like fig 2)
{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}
Scale underlies the study of ecology and arguarably all of science. There is no "correct" scale to look at in ecology - it depends on the context and problem. There are often properties that emerge from one level to affect the next level.
How do you construct simple models to elucidate patterns in the real world?

The evolution of life history traits is driven by different processes at different scales. Often, it is best to study processes on a different scale than the one of true interest. For example, small scale studies are often driven by stochastic variation where analysis is difficult. If you use a larger scale, ensemble averages can become useful for studying the phenomenon of interest. 


Pattern formation and scale are inheriently linked together. Often patterns emerges from one scale to affect another. Mechanisms need to be understood so as to allow real predictive power istead of simply correlation. Theory creates a set of possible mechanisms and experimentation must weed through this set. In one example, it was shown that krill movement dynamics differed depending on what scale the phenomenon was measured at. Therefore two different processes were driving the dynamics.

The focus is on why are organisms distributed the way they are. Use random walk and diffusion models for dispersal models. Can ignore the individuals and use the law of large numbers. Apply models of phyics to examples in biology. Phytoplankton. Spread of invasive species. 

Methods from aquatic systems can also be applied in the terrestrial realm. It is not always possible to delineate scales easily...

Metapopulation models have been a centerpiece of theoretical ecology. These models have been important in conservation, evolution, and epidemiology. 

A lot of work has been done in analyzing food webs from a mathematical (i.e. graph theory) viewpoint. 

Linking scales between GCC and ecological models in a continual challenge. 

Scaling is also important in understanding evolution. How do forces on individuals affect patterns seen on community and ecosystem levels? It is important to figure out which level of detail to include.},

We derive an analytic approximation which describes how the desynchronizing influence of local environmental stochasticity combines with the synchronizing influences of larger scale environmental stochastic variation and migration to determine population cross correlation coefficients. Despite the simplifications made by this analysis, computer simulations show that the behaviour of more complicated models is well described by our approximation over considerable regions of parameter space. We conclude that population synchrony is largely determined by the coefficients of variation (CVs) of the local and larger scale stochastic processes, and that migration alone is only likely to maintain population synchrony when the CV of the local stochastic process is very small.},

In this paper, we ask how changes in seasonal fluctuations impact on the population cycles. We use the Fennoscandian vole system as a case study, focusing on variations in the length of the breeding season. We use a predator-prey model that includes generalist and specialist predation alongside seasonal forcing. Using a combination of bifurcation analysis and direct simulations, we consider the effects of varying both the level of generalist predation and the length of the breeding season; these are the main changes that occur over a latitudinal gradient in Fennoscandia. We predict that varying the breeding season length leads to changes in the period of the multi-year cycles, with a higher period for shorter breeding season lengths. This concurs with the gradient of periodicity found in Fennoscandia. The Fennoscandian vole system is only one of many populations that are affected by geographical and temporal changes in seasonality; thus our results highlight the importance of considering these changes in other population systems.},

abstract = {One of the current challenges in evolutionary ecology is understanding the long-term persistence of contemporary-evolving predator-prey interactions across space and time. To address this, we developed an extension of a multi-locus, multi-trait eco-evolutionary individual-based model that incorporates several interacting species in explicit landscapes. We simulated eco-evolutionary dynamics of multiple species food webs with different degrees of connectance across soil-moisture islands. A broad set of parameter combinations led to the local extinction of species, but some species persisted, and this was associated with (1) high connectance and omnivory and (2) ongoing evolution, due to multi-trait genetic variability of the embedded species. Furthermore, persistence was highest at intermediate island distances, likely because of a balance between predation-induced extinction (strongest at short island distances) and the coupling of island diversity by top predators, which by travelling among islands exert global top-down control of biodiversity. In the simulations with high genetic variation, we also found widespread trait evolutionary changes indicative of eco-evolutionary dynamics. We discuss how the ever-increasing computing power and high-resolution data availability will soon allow researchers to start bridging the in vivo-in silico gap. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

They want to merge space, food webs, and evolution

Use soil food webs as an example system

Use program called Weaver- IBM approach of food webs that are heterogenous in space

Interested in food web persistence, connectance, genetic variation, role of spatial strucute

-Looked at varying level of connectivity and genetic variation in a 20 species food web where each species had 13 characteerstics - food webs eere also on four micro islands. Ran 5 simulations of each scenario

Results
-increased connectence (with lots of omnivory) allowed for more species to coexist - specifically it increased predator persistence but decreassed prey persistence

-{\textgreater} this is a bit suprising in light of May's work. Connectance should be destabalizing? It depends on cannabalism and other feedbacks

-gen var also helped persistence

When predators are around population sizes of predators changes which affects seleciton pressures

McCann, Hastings papers on higher connectance and strong omnivory being stabalizing

Genetic variability can help stablity by allowing rapid evolution (that affects pop dyn) or by increasing connectance in the web (b/c of diversity of interactions present with high gen var)

Evolution can be stabalizing or destabalizing

Term "growth ratio" - not common term

Intermediant distances b/w patches with predators present allow the most prey persistence

abstract = {Harvesting for food or sport is often non-random with respect to demographic state, such as size or life stage. The population-level consequences of such selective harvesting depend upon which states are harvested and how those states contribute to population dynamics. We focused on a form of selective harvesting that has not previously been investigated in an experimental context: sex-selective harvesting, a common feature of exploited, dioecious populations. Using simple metapopulations (two patches connect by dispersal) of sexually dimorphic Bruchid beetles in the laboratory, we contrasted the effects of female-selective, male-selective, and non-selective harvesting over six generation of population dynamics. We also tested the ability of a harvest refuge (one patch of the metapopulation free from harvesting) to mitigate the effects of harvesting, and whether refuge effects interacted with sex selectivity. Sex-selective harvesting significantly perturbed operational sex ratios and harvest refuges dampened these perturbations. Metapopulations assigned to male-selective and non-selective treatments were able to fully compensate for harvesting, such that their dynamics did not differ from non-harvested controls. Only female-selective harvesting led to significant reductions in population size and this effect was completely offset by dispersal from a harvest refuge. A two-sex model confirmed that population dynamics are more sensitive to female vs. male harvesting, but suggested that higher levels of male harvest than included in our experiment would cause population decline. We discuss the roles of density-dependent competition and frequency-dependent sexual processes in the population response to sex-selective harvesting.},

abstract = {Scientific theories seek to provide simple explanations for significant empirical regularities based on fundamental physical and mechanistic constraints. Biological theories have rarely reached a level of generality and predictive power comparable to physical theories. This discrepancy is explained through a combination of frozen accidents, environmental heterogeneity, and widespread non-linearities observed in adaptive processes. At the same time, model building has proven to be very successful when it comes to explaining and predicting the behavior of particular biological systems. In this respect biology resembles alternative model-rich frameworks, such as economics and engineering. In this paper we explore the prospects for general theories in biology, and suggest that these take inspiration not only from physics, but also from the information sciences. Future theoretical biology is likely to represent a hybrid of parsimonious reasoning and algorithmic or rule-based explanation. An open question is whether these new frameworks will remain transparent to human reason. In this context, we discuss the role of machine learning in the early stages of scientific discovery. We argue that evolutionary history is not only a source of uncertainty, but also provides the basis, through conserved traits, for very general explanations for biological regularities, and the prospect of unified theories of life.},

Much of this research has focused on phenology – the timing of life-history events. Phenology has well-demonstrated links to climate, from genetic to landscape scales; yet our ability to explain and predict variation in phenology across species, habitats and time remains poor. Here, we outline how merging approaches from ecology, climate science and evolutionary biology can advance research on phenological responses to climate variability. Using insight into seasonal and interannual climate variability combined with niche theory and community phylogenetics, we develop a predictive approach for species' reponses to changing climate. Our approach predicts that species occupying higher latitudes or the early growing season should be most sensitive to climate and have the most phylogenetically conserved phenologies. We further predict that temperate species will respond to climate change by shifting in time, while tropical species will respond by shifting space, or by evolving. Although we focus here on plant phenology, our approach is broadly applicable to ecological research of plant responses to climate variability.},

abstract = {Movements and habitat preferences of sharks rel- ative to a central location are widely documented for many species; however, the reasons for such behaviors are cur- rently unknown. Do movements vary spatially or temporally or between individuals? Do sharks have seasonal habitat and environmental preferences or simply perform movements at random at any time of the year? To help understand require- ments for the designation of critical habitats for an endan- gered top predator and to develop zoning and management plans for key habitats, we examined vertical and horizon- tal movements, and determined habitat and environmental preferences of scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini). We tracked seven hammerheads for 19–96 h at Wolf Island (1.38{\textordmasculine}N, 91.82{\textordmasculine}W) between 2007 and 2009 using ultra- sonic transmitters with depth and temperature sensors, and we profiled temperature through the water column. Move- ments of individual hammerheads fell in two classes: con- strained (remaining near the island) and dispersive (moving offshore to pelagic environments). The central activity space or kernel off the southeast side of Wolf Island was small and common to most, but the area varied among individuals (mean ± SE 0.25 ± 0.2 km2), not exceeding 0.6 km2 for any of the sharks, and not changing significantly between sea- sons. In general, hammerheads showed preference for the up- current habitat on the eastern side of Wolf Island in both the warm and cold seasons. However, the depth of sharks varied with season, apparently in response to seasonal changes in the vertical structure of temperature. Hammerheads performed frequent vertical excursions above the thermocline during offshore movements and, in general, were observed to pre- fer temperatures of 23–26 °C found above the thermocline. At times, though individuals moved into the thermocline and made brief dives below it. Our results provided evidence that hammerheads (1) are highly selective of location (i.e., habitat on up-current side of island) and depth (i.e., top of the ther- mocline) while refuging, where they may carry out essential activities such as cleaning and thermoregulation, and (2) per- form exploratory vertical movements by diving the width of the mixed layer and occasionally diving below the thermo- cline while moving offshore, most likely for foraging.},

abstract = {The evolutionarily stable (or ESS) emergence schedule for males of univoltine butterflies is analysed in an environment in which the female emergence schedule fluctuates stochastically between years. The ESS emergence curve, computed using the mutant invadability criterion, is shown to be the one that maximizes mean logarithmic lifetime mating success in the population in which it dominates. If males have accurate information about the female emergence schedule within each year, their emergence curve would evolve to the one predicted by a deterministic game model. The male emergence curve would then shift between years, closely following year to year changes in the female emergence pattern. If, instead, males have uncertainty about the female emergence schedule, the ESS male emergence curve becomes broader than the one predicted by the deterministic game model and will not track the between-year fluctuation of female emergence well. In a special case, we show how the between-year variation of mean emergence date, the variance of emergence date, the sexual difference in mean emergence dates (protandry) and the between-year correlation of mean emergence dates of both sexes should change with the degree of accuracy of information available to males.},

-Iwasa et al (1983) looked at same question with field data but did not investigate environmental stochasticity or spatial heterogeneity, the latter of which was investigate by Baughman et al (1988)

-males will have ESS that is the same each year, even if females fluctuate, if there is no accurate cue for them to use

-discuss situation when a cue is available

Summary:
This paper examines the ESS emergence times of males in an environment where female emergence varies between years. Male emergence time is strongly selected for as females typically only mate once. However, there is high male mortality rates per day, so it is dangerous to emerge too soon. If males had perfect information about female emergence, the maximized emergence curve would be the deterministic game model. But, when the environment varies and a cue is not perfect, the male emergence times will be broader than that of the females.},

abstract = {Networks of citizen scientists (CS) have the potential to observe biodiversity and species distributions at global scales. Yet the adoption of such datasets in conservation science may be hindered by a perception that the data are of low quality. This perception likely stems from the propensity of data generated by CS to contain greater levels of variability (e.g., measurement error) or bias (e.g., spatio-temporal clustering) in comparison to data collected by scientists or instruments. Modern analytical approaches can account for many types of error and bias typical of CS datasets. It is possible to (1) describe how pseudo-replica- tion in sampling influences the overall variability in response data using mixed-effects modeling, (2) inte- grate data to explicitly model the sampling process and account for bias using a hierarchical modeling framework, and (3) examine the relative influence of many different or related explanatory factors using machine learning tools. Information from these modeling approaches can be used to predict species dis- tributions and to estimate biodiversity. Even so, achieving the full potential from CS projects requires meta-data describing the sampling process, reference data to allow for standardization, and insightful modeling suitable to the question of interest.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent decades, large pelagic and coastal shark populations have declined dramatically with increased fishing; however, the status of sharks in other systems such as coral reefs remains largely unassessed despite a long history of exploitation. Here we explore the contemporary distribution and sighting frequency of sharks on reefs in the greater-Caribbean and assess the possible role of human pressures on observed patterns. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed 76,340 underwater surveys carried out by trained volunteer divers between 1993 and 2008. Surveys were grouped within one km2 cells, which allowed us to determine the contemporary geographical distribution and sighting frequency of sharks. Sighting frequency was calculated as the ratio of surveys with sharks to the total number of surveys in each cell. We compared sighting frequency to the number of people in the cell vicinity and used population viability analyses to assess the effects of exploitation on population trends. Sharks, with the exception of nurse sharks occurred mainly in areas with very low human population or strong fishing regulations and marine conservation. Population viability analysis suggests that exploitation alone could explain the large-scale absence; however, this pattern is likely to be exacerbated by additional anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and habitat degradation, that also correlate with human population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Human pressures in coastal zones have lead to the broad-scale absence of sharks on reefs in the greater-Caribbean. Preventing further loss of sharks requires urgent management measures to curb fishing mortality and to mitigate other anthropogenic stressors to protect sites where sharks still exist. The fact that sharks still occur in some densely populated areas where strong fishing regulations are in place indicates the possibility of success and encourages the implementation of conservation measures.},

The unusual rate and extent of anthropogenic alterations of the environment may exceed the capacity of developmental, genetic, and demographic mechanisms that populations have evolved to deal with environmental change. To begin to understand the limits to population persistence, we present a simple evolutionary model for the critical rate of environmental change beyond which a population must decline and go extinct. We use this model to highlight the major determinants of extinction risk in a changing environment, and identify research needs for improved predictions based on projected changes in environmental variables. Two key parameters relating the environment to population biology have not yet received sufficient attention. Phenotypic plasticity, the direct influence of environment on the development of individual phenotypes, is increasingly considered an important component of phenotypic change in the wild and should be incorporated in models of population persistence. Environmental sensitivity of selection, the change in the optimum phenotype with the environment, still crucially needs empirical assessment. We use environmental tolerance curves and other examples of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change to illustrate how these mechanistic approaches can be developed for predictive purposes.},

abstract = {Disease effects on host population dynamics and the transmission of pathogens between hosts are two important challenges for understanding how epizootics wax and wane and how disease influences host population dynamics. For the management of marine shellfish resources, marine diseases pose additional challenges in early intervention after the appearance of disease, management of the diseased population to limit a decline in host abundance, and application of measures to restrain that decline once it occurs. Mathematical models provide one approach for quantifying these effects and addressing the competing goals of managing the diseased population versus managing the disease. The majority of models for molluscan diseases fall into three categories distinguished by these competing goals. (1) Models that consider disease effects on the host population tend to focus on pathogen proliferation within the host. Many of the well-known molluscan diseases are pandemic, in that they routinely reach high prevalence rapidly over large geographic expanses, are characterized by transmission that does not depend upon a local source, and exert a significant influence on host population dynamics. Models focused on disease proliferation examine the influence of environmental change on host population metrics and provide a basis to better manage diseased stocks. Such models are readily adapted to questions of fishery management and habitat restoration. (2) Transmission models are designed to understand the mechanisms triggering epizootics, identify factors impeding epizootic development, and evaluate controls on the rate of disease spread over the host's range. Transmission models have been used extensively to study terrestrial diseases, yet little attention has been given to their potential for understanding the epidemiology of marine molluscan diseases. For management of diseases of wild stocks, transmission models open up a range of options, including the application of area management, manipulation of host abundance, and use of scavengers and filter feeders to limit the concentration of infective particles. (3) The details of host population processes and pathogen transmission dynamics are blended in models that evaluate the effects of natural selection and/or genetic modification in developing disease resistance in the host population. Application of gene-based models to marine diseases is only now beginning and represents a promising approach that may provide a mechanistic basis for managing marine diseases and their host populations. Overall disease models remain both uncommon and underutilized in addressing the needs for managing molluscan diseases and their host populations.},

abstract = {Before the development of mass-vaccination campaigns, measles exhibited persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British cities, and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities. The critical community size separating the two regimes was {\~{}}300 000-500 000. We develop a model, the TSIR (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era (1944-1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3× 106 inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission ("true mass action"). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is found to be invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3{\%} interval. The disease is, thus, efficient in "regulating" the susceptible population-even in small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is nearly "deterministic" through most of the growth and decline phase.},

We assume that the total number of juveniles one adult individual can produce is a finite constant, and we study how this number should be distributed during the season, given the types of inter-individual interactions and mortality processes included in the model. The evolution of the timing of reproduction in this modeling framework has already been studied earlier in the case of equilibrium resident dynamics, but we generalize the situation to also fluctuating population dynamics. We find that, as in the equilibrium case, the presence or absence of inter-juvenile aggression affects the functional form of the evolutionarily stable reproductive strategy. If an ESS exists, it can have an absolutely continuous part only if inter-juvenile aggression is included in the model. If inter-juvenile aggression is not included in the model, an ESS can have no continuous parts, and only Dirac measures are possible.},

Systematic review of 113 FEs across 20 countries revealed that clear articulation of experimental objectives, while not universally practiced, was crucial for achieving management outcomes and changing dam-operating policies. Furthermore, changes to dam operations were three times less likely when FEs were conducted primarily for scientific purposes. Despite the recognized importance of riverine flow regimes, four-fifths of FEs involved only discrete flow events. Over three-quarters of FEs documented both abiotic and biotic outcomes, but only one-third examined multiple taxonomic responses, thus limiting how FE results can inform holistic dam management.

abstract = {Current global marine protection targets aim to protect 10-30{\%} of marine habitats within the next 3 - 5 years. However, these targets were adopted without prior assessment of their achievability. Moreover, ability to monitor progress towards such targets has been constrained by a lack of robust data on marine protected areas. Here we present the results of the first explicitly marine-focused, global assessment of protected areas in relation to global marine protection targets. Approximately 2.35 million km2, 0.65{\%} of the world's oceans and 1.6{\%} of the total marine area within Exclusive Economic Zones, are currently protected. Only 0.08{\%} of the world's oceans, and 0.2{\%} of the total marine area under national jurisdiction is no-take. The global distribution of protected areas is both uneven and unrepresentative at multiple scales, and only half of the world's marine protected areas are part of a coherent network. Since 1984 the spatial extent of marine area protected globally has grown at an annual rate of 4.6{\%}, at which even the most modest target is unlikely to be met for at least several decades rather than within the coming decade. These results validate concerns over the relevance and utility of broad conservation targets. However, given the low level of protection for marine ecosystems, a more immediate global concern is the need for a rapid increase in marine protected area coverage. In this case, the process of comparing targets to their expected achievement dates may help to mobilize support for the policy shifts and increased resources needed to improve the current level of marine protection.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Methods are needed to predict how such environmental variation affects ecological and evolutionary processes, in order to design effective strategies to conserve biodiversity under global change. Here, we review recent theoretical and empirical studies to assess: (1) how populations respond to changes in environmental variance, and (2) how environmental variance affects population responses to changes in mean conditions. Contrary to frequent claims, empirical studies show that increases in environmental variance can increase as well as decrease long-term population growth rates. Moreover, environmental variance can alter and even reverse the effects of changes in the mean environment, such that even if environmental variance remains constant, omitting it from population models compromises their ability to predict species' responses to changes in mean conditions. Drawing on theory relating these effects of environmental variance to the curvatures of population growth responses to the environment, we outline how species' traits such as phylogenetic history and body mass could be used to predict their responses to global change under future environmental variability.},

abstract = {Marine diseases are a strong selective force that can have important economic and ecological consequences. Larval dispersal patterns, selective mortality and individual growth rates can modulate metapopulation responses to disease pressure. Here, we use a modeling framework that includes distinct populations, connected via larval transport, with varying disease selection pressure and connectivity to examine how these dynamics enhance or inhibit the evolu-tion of disease resistance in metapopulations. Our system, oysters and MSX disease, is one in which disease resistance is highly and demonstrably heritable. Simulations show that under con-ditions of population isolation (i.e. local retention of larvae) and strong disease selection, popula-tions rapidly evolve genetic disease resistance. Varying the patterns of larval dispersal alone dou-bles the time for evolution of disease resistance. Spatially varying disease in the absence of larval dispersal leaves some populations unable to respond to the disease, whereas adding larval disper-sal slows the response of populations under strong selection and speeds the response in popula-tions under low selection when fitness is based on relatively limited genetic structure (‘juvenile fitness' in our simulations). Under spatially variable disease pressure, larval dispersal generates a fourfold greater variance in fitness outcomes across the dispersal patterns tested. In a meta -population, populations experiencing lower selection pressure will tend to slow the development of other, more heavily selected populations. This suggests that conservation efforts aimed at improving overall metapopulation resistance in the face of marine diseases should target those populations under modest or high disease pressure, rather than protecting those experiencing low selective pressure.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper reviews the changes in quanti- tative marine fisheries management between 1985 and 2010. The two primary areas where quantitative methods have been employed are in the assessment of stock size and exploitation rates, and in the design and evaluation of harvest strategies. In 1985, some areas had well established assessment programs in place, and the assessment methods have been relatively stable over the 25 years in question. In other places, the evolution of methods has been much more dramatic, and where there were either no assessments performed or early virtual pop- ulation analysis (VPA) was done using mainly catch-at-age data, complex statistical models using maximum likelihood or Bayesian statistics are now common. Harvest strategies have generally evolved even more. In 1985, most harvest strategies were based on fixed exploitation rates from yield-per-recruit analyses. By 2010, most agencies had adopted harvest strate- gies that specifically reduced exploitation rates as abundance dropped below the biomass that will produce maximum sus- tainable yield. Simulation testing of these harvest strategies has become an integral part of their design, often using the uncertainty from the assessments to bound the robustness tri- als for the harvest strategy. Two major areas of new quantita- tive methods are (i) spatially explicit models that can be used for marine spatial planning, and (ii) in ecosystem models to evaluate ecosystem wide impacts of fishing.

abstract = {The effect of resource subsidies on recipient food webs has received much recent attention. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of significant seasonal seaweed deposition events, caused by hurricanes and other storms, on species inhabiting subtropical islands. The seaweed represents a pulsed resource subsidy that is consumed by amphipods and flies, which are eaten by lizards and predatory arthropods, which in turn consume terrestrial herbivores. Additionally, seaweed decomposes directly into the soil under plants. We added seaweed to six shoreline plots and removed seaweed from six other plots for three months; all plots were repeatedly monitored for 12 months after the initial manipulation. Lizard density (Anolis sagrei) responded rapidly, and the overall average was 63{\%} higher in subsidized than in removal plots. Stable-isotope analysis revealed a shift in lizard diet composition toward more marine-based prey in subsidized plots. Leaf damage was 70{\%} higher in subsidized than in removal plots after eight months, but subsequent damage was about the same in the two treatments. Foliage growth rate was 70{\%} higher in subsidized plots after 12 months. Results of a complementary study on the relationship between natural variation in marine subsidies and island food web components were consistent with the experimental results. We suggest two causal pathways for the effects of marine subsidies on terrestrial plants: (1) the "fertilization effect" in which seaweed adds nutrients to plants, increasing their growth rate, and (2) the "predator diet shift effect" in which lizards shift from eating local prey (including terrestrial herbivores) to eating mostly marine detritivores.},

Natural microcosms may represent an middle-ground between artificial experiments and large-scale studies. Microcosms may be well-suited to study metacommunity theory as multiple microcosms can be located near each other and search as 'patches'. It seems that microcosms are as useful as any experiment or theory-approach. They can elucidate potential mechanisms but if they do not compare to the real world, then our understanding of the system is incorrect. Artifical and natural systems need to be used with theoretical approaches to get a real understanding of ecological questions. },

Predictions of climate-induced population extinctions are supported by geographic range shifts that correspond to climatic warming, but few extinctions have been linked mechanistically to climate change. Here we show that extinctions of two populations of a checkerspot butterfly were hastened by increasing variability in precipitation, a phenomenon predicted by global climate models. We model checkerspot populations to show that changes in precipitation amplified population fluctuations, leading to rapid extinctions. As populations of checkerspots and other species become further isolated by habitat loss, climate change is likely to cause more extinctions, threatening both species diversity and critical ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Interspecific interactions often determine the structure and stability of biotic communities. In low-productivity and highly seasonal environments such as the alpine tundra, most interactions occur during a short, snow-free period. The strength and direction of these interactions are likely to be determined by the availability of resources, particularly among species of the same ecological guild. Understanding how species interact in such environments can provide insights into the conditions that facilitate their coexistence. We determined the potential for interspecific interactions among 3 resident medium-sized mammalian herbivores inhabiting the alpine tundra and investigated how they share available space and resources. Overlap in their respective activity areas indicated that these species were aggregated at a landscape scale, but other mechanisms allowed their coexistence at a finer scale. Their distributions were primarily associated with shorter distances to heterospecifics and, secondly, with habitat features related to shelter and escape from predation. Our results suggest that these species can (and do) coexist by partitioning their ecological niches. Competition is likely not a major factor in structuring these communities; in turn, facilitative mechanisms may allow co-occurrence of these sympatric herbivores in seasonal, low productivity environments.},

abstract = {Many biologists are asking whether environmentally initiated phenotypic change (i.e., 'phenotypic plasticity') precedes, and even facilitates, evolutionary adaptation. However, this 'plasticity-first' hypothesis remains controversial, primarily because comprehensive tests from natural populations are generally lacking. We briefly describe the plasticity-first hypothesis and present much-needed key criteria to allow tests in diverse, natural systems. Furthermore, we offer a framework for how these criteria can be evaluated and discuss examples where the plasticity-first hypothesis has been investigated in natural populations. Our goal is to provide a means by which the role of plasticity in adaptive evolution can be assessed. Phenotypic plasticity has long been proposed to precede and possibly facilitate adaptive evolution.This 'plasticity-first hypothesis' is controversial because skeptics argue that it lacks compelling evidence from natural populations.A chief difficulty with demonstrating plasticity-first evolution in natural populations is that, once a trait has evolved, its evolution cannot be studied in situ. To get around this difficulty, researchers can study extant lineages that act as ancestral-proxies to the lineage possessing the focal trait.Using such an approach, key criteria of the plasticity-first hypothesis can be evaluated using a relatively simple experimental design.Applying these criteria to various systems, the plasticity-first hypothesis has some empirical support. However, more studies are needed to conclusively determine the role of plasticity in adaptive evolution.},

Chapter 1:
-many decision to make and potentially several objectives
-confusion of values (or objectives) with science (data or information)
-structured decision making consists of three parts: 1) specific objective in place, 2) different strategies that could meet objectives, and 3) predictive models to evalulate different strategies effect on objectives
- a structured approach is needed so decision do not look arbitary
-adaptive resource management extends SDM to case where outcomes of decisions are uncertain
- for adaptive managment they argue that decisions have to be recurrent, models need to include information on structural uncertainty, and monitoring must be in place

Chapter 2:
-state problem, define objectives, paths to solve objective, define spatial and temporal bounds of problem, identify potential sticking points or problems, acknodwledge uncertianty
-need clear seperation betweeen beliefs (knowledge on system) and values
- need some model of how decisions may affect system state
-various types of uncertainty: enviornmental, partial controlability (other random effects may affect our actions), statistical (sampling) variability, and structural uncertainty
-can include uncertainty or conduct optimization that expliently seeks to avoid bad outcomes (more like robust optimization)

Chapter 3:
-need to distriguish between fundamental (ultimate goal) and means (sub goals to get to fundamental goal) objectives
-reduce barriers to creative decision making
-competing and conflicting objectives
-hidden vs stranded objectives
-create decision networks which go from fundmental to means objectives and then lower to actual actions that could be taken
-issues with multiple objectives: common currency, conlficitng objectivese, some objectives may be more important
-often need to use utility function with multiple objectives, or use one objective as constraint and to max the other

Chapter 5:
- basic statistical terms (probability, conditional probability, independence, complementary, law of total probability, Bayes theorem, probabibility distributions, support of distributions, expected values, utility, linear models)
- given examples of all these concepts in R boxes
- more advanced statistical concepts (hierarchical models for shared information and non independent samples)
- make point that shared information is important for rare species or populations with little data collected)
-Bayesian inference

Chapter 6:
-influence diagrams
- common mistakes (not including all costs, not including uncertainties, defining linkage meanings)
- defining node states (are things yes/no, or continuous numbers)
-decision trees
-solving for optimal decisions. Often it may be best to use suboptimal decision, termed satisficing decision
-discuss how to use and acquire expert opinions
-software available for making diagrams and estimating paramters

Chapter 7
- irreducible and reducible (e.g. language or epistemoligical ) uncertainty
-epistemic unceratinty can include staitical, observantional, and structural uncertainty
-with uncertainty could look at expected value
- alternative is termed minimax = minmize loss for worst case outcome - not usually used
- could also use risk profiling
--need to include risk attitudes, people may prefer certainty rather than high risk/reward scenario
-other terms risk premium and risk tolerence
-can calculate value of additional or better information
-can try to reduce epistemic uncertainty: experimentaiton, retrospective data analysis, or through adaptive resource management
-nice Bayesian updating example under adaptive management framework
-single (keeping with same objectives but changing behavior) vs double-loop (altering objectives and models) forms of adaptive managment
-passive vs active ARM


Chapter 8


Seperate: Expert informatinon (pg. 180)
-indirect vs direct approaches and quantiative vs qualitative
- 4 approaches: have expert directly estimate probabilities, frequency elicitation (have someone estimate fraction of population that will surivie and use this to estimate probabilities), value elicitation (unrelated value estimatino that can be used in a distribution) , function elicitation
-need to quantify uncertainty in expert judgement (ask what is the lowest, highest, most likely values, and how confident are you in the interval you created?)

abstract = {Classical metapopulations are groups of local populations living in networks of spatially distinct habitat patches in a balance between local extinctions and recolonizations of empty habitat. Models are needed for understanding and predicting metapopulation dynamics in changing landscapes. One particularly important question is what is the effect of habitat loss to the persistence of a metapopulation. A class of metapopulation models that have been successfully used in practical applications are called stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs), which model the presence/absence of the species on habitat patches as a Markov chain. The presence-absence assumption makes the model relatively parameter sparse, facilitates empirical data collection, and enables rigorous parameter estimation. This study reviews theory of SPOMs and describes a computational tool, called SPOMSIM, which allows one to simulate SPOMs and estimate parameters for them. SPOMSIM offers a range of choices for submodels; alternatives are provided for the functional forms of local extinction, the dispersal kernel, computation of connectivity, the colonization function, the implementation of the rescue effect and the implementation of regional stochasticity. SPOMSIM includes also, among other things, a utility based on hierarchical clustering for the analysis of the structure of a patch network, a reserve network optimization algorithm, and a patch system editor which makes it possible to investigate the consequences of changes in landscape structure. Potential uses for SPOMSIM include scientific metapopulation studies, teaching and conservation management. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here, fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and temporal scales. Yet more empirical evidence is needed to test the generality of these effects throughout the ocean.},

Although this process is a major generator of biodiversity, its genetic basis is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the genetic architecture of niche differentiation in a sympatric species pair of threespine stickleback fish by mapping the environment-dependent effects of phenotypic traits on hybrid feeding and performance under semi-natural conditions. We show that multiple, unlinked loci act largely additively to determine position along the major niche axis separating these recently diverged species. We also find that functional mismatch between phenotypic traits reduces the growth of some stickleback hybrids beyond that expected from an intermediate phenotype, suggesting a role for epistasis between the underlying genes. This functional mismatch might lead to hybrid incompatibilities that are analogous to those underlying intrinsic reproductive isolation but depend on the ecological context.},

abstract = {Understanding spatial variation in biodiversity along environmental gradients is a central theme in ecology. Differences in species compositional turnover among sites ($\beta$ diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in $\beta$ diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that $\beta$ diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness ($\gamma$ diversity), these differences in $\beta$ diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of $\beta$ diversity.},
annote = {This study tries to determine what the actual drivers of beta diversity gradients are. They find that beta diversity gradients (both in latitude and elevation) disappear when accounting for gamma diversity using a null modeling approach. This implies that beta diversity gradients is more likely driven by gamma diversity rather than mechanisms of small scale community assembly.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Around the world, researchers are using the observations and experiences of citizens to describe patterns in animal populations. This data is often collected via ongoing sampling or by synthesizing past experiences. Since elasmobranchs are relatively rare, obtaining data for broad-scale trend analysis requires high sampling effort. Elasmobranchs are also relatively large and conspicuous and therefore it may be possible to enlist recreational divers to collect data on their occurrence and relative abundance from daily dive activities. For this, however, a good understanding of the value of data collected by recreational divers is essential. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we explore the value of recreational divers for censusing elasmobranchs using a diverse set of data sources. First, we use a simulation experiment to explore detection rates of the roving diver technique, used by recreational divers, across a range of fish densities and speeds. Next, using a field survey, we show that inexperienced recreational divers detect and count elasmobranchs as well as experienced recreational divers. Finally, we use semi-structured interviews of recreational dive instructors to demonstrate the value of their recollections in terms of effort and their descriptions of spatial and temporal distributions of sharks in Thailand. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, this study provides initial ground-work for using recreational divers for monitoring elasmobranch populations. If used appropriately, citizen-collected data may provide additional information that can be used to complement more standardized surveys and to describe population trends across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Due to the non-extractive nature of this data, recreational divers may also provide important insight into the success of conservation initiatives, such as shark sanctuaries and no-take zones.},

abstract = {Abstract Network analysis has a long history in the mathematical and social sciences and the aim of this introduction is to provide a brief overview of the potential that it holds for the study of animal behaviour. One of the most attractive features of the network paradigm is that it provides a single conceptual framework with which we can study the social organisation of animals at all levels (individual, dyad, group, population) and for all types of interaction (aggressive, cooperative, sexual etc.). Graphical tools allow a visual inspection of networks which often helps inspire ideas for testable hypotheses. Network analysis itself provides a multitude of novel statistical tools that can be used to characterise social patterns in animal populations. Among the important insights that networks have facilitated is that indirect social connections matter. Interactions between individuals generate a social environ- ment at the population level which in turn selects for behavioural strategies at the individual level. A social network is often a perfect means by which to represent heterogeneous relationships in a population. Probing the biological drivers for these heterogeneities, often as a function of time, forms the basis of many of the current uses of network analysis in the behavioural sciences. This special issue on social networks brings together a diverse group of practitioners whose study systems range from social insects over reptiles to birds, cetaceans, ungulates and primates in order to illustrate the wide-ranging applications of network analysis.},

Over 200,000 individuals, comprising 175 spe- cies, were identified from catches of block nets, seines, and trawls between March 2000 and March 2003. The Index of Relative Importance (IRI), which is typically used for dietary analysis and combines percentage weight, abundance and occur- rence, was applied to catch data to enable easy spatial and temporal variations in community composition. Cluster-analysis revealed distinct mangrove and seagrass communities, with Morisita's index indicating a greater degree of spatial and tempo- ral homogeneity in the North Sound. Catch diversity and biomass were significantly greater in the mangroves than over seagrass in both locations, and highest off South Bimini. Low productivity, faunal diversity, and abundance in the North Sound were probably due to extreme abiotic variables. Juveniles of most species were present in mangroves and seagrass beds around Bimini, and therefore the protection of man- groves in the Bahamas should be an issue of immediate concern.},

Dietary overlap was high between males and females. An ontogenetic shift was observed in the diet. Smaller prey (e.g. cephalopods, teleosts and sea snakes) were more common in small individuals, while the occurrence of larger prey (e.g. turtles, dugongs and elasmobranchs) increased with increasing shark size. Differences in the diet were observed between four regions along the centralWestern Australian coast. The ability to catch and consume large prey, prey availability, prey density, and prey profitability were identified as factors influencing the diet. The high level of occurrence of dugongs and turtles in the diet of G. cuvier, relative to their abundance, suggests that shark predation may play an important role in regulating populations of these species.},

abstract = {Bycatch--the incidental catch of nontarget species--is a principal concern in marine conservation and fisheries management. In the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna fishery, a large fraction of nonmammal bycatch is captured by purse-seine gear when nets are deployed around floating objects. We examined the spatial distribution of a dominant species in this fishery's bycatch, the apex predator silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from 1994 to 2005 to determine whether spatial closures, areas where fishing is prohibited, might effectively reduce the bycatch of this species. We then identified candidate locations for fishery closures that specifically considered the trade-off between bycatch reduction and the loss of tuna catch and evaluated ancillary conservation benefits to less commonly captured taxa. Smoothed spatial distributions of silky shark bycatch did not indicate persistent small areas of especially high bycatch for any size class of shark over the 12-year period. Nevertheless, bycatch of small silky sharks ({\textless}90 cm total length) was consistently higher north of the equator during all years. On the basis of this distribution, we evaluated nearly 100 candidate closure areas between 5°N and 15°N that could have reduced, by as much as 33{\%}, the total silky shark bycatch while compromising only 12{\%} of the tuna catch. Although silky sharks are the predominant species of elasmobranchs caught as bycatch in this fishery, closures also suggested reductions in the bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, including other shark species and turtles. Our technique provides an effective method with which to balance the costs and benefits of conservation in fisheries management. Spatial closures are a viable management tool, but implementation should be preceded by careful consideration of the consequences of fishing reallocation.},

abstract = {In the marine environment, humans exploit natural ecosystems for food and economic benefit. Challenging policy goals have been set to protect resources, species, communities and habitats, yet ecologists often have sparse data on interactions occurring in the system to assess policy outcomes. This paper presents a technique, loosely based on Bayesian Belief Networks, to create simple models which 1) predict whether individual species within a community will decline or increase in population size, 2) encapsulate uncertainty in the predictions in an intuitive manner and 3) require limited knowledge of the ecosystem and functional parameters required to model it. We develop our model for a UK rocky shore community, to utilise existing knowledge of species interactions for model validation purposes. However, we also test the role of expert opinion, without full scientific knowledge of species interactions, by asking non-UK based marine scientists to derive parameters for the model (non-UK scientists are not familiar with the exact communities being described and will need to extrapolate from existing knowledge in a similar manner to model a poorly studied system). We find these differ little from the parameters derived by ourselves and make little difference to the final model predictions. We also test our model against simple experimental manipulations, and find that the most important changes in community structure as a result of manipulations correspond well to the model predictions with both our, and non-UK expert parameterisation. The simplicity of the model, nature of the outputs, and the user-friendly interface makes it potentially suitable for policy, conservation and management work on multispecies interactions in a wide range of marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {1. The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution has historically been a contentious issue because of debate over whether plasticity shields genotypes from selection or generates novel opportunities for selection to act. Because plasticity encompasses diverse adaptive and non-adaptive responses to environmental variation, no single conceptual framework adequately predicts the diverse roles of plasticity in evolutionary change. 2. Different types of phenotypic plasticity can uniquely contribute to adaptive evolution when populations are faced with new or altered environments. Adaptive plasticity should promote establishment and persistence in a new environment, but depending on how close the plastic response is to the new favoured phenotypic optimum dictates whether directional selection will cause adaptive divergence between populations. Further, non-adaptive plasticity in response to stressful environments can result in a mean phenotypic response being further away from the favoured optimum or alternatively increase the variance around the mean due to the expression of cryptic genetic variation. The expression of cryptic genetic variation can facilitate adaptive evolution if by chance it results in a fitter phenotype. 3. We conclude that adaptive plasticity that places populations close enough to a new phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time-scales in new environments. However, this type of plasticity is likely to be the product of past selection on variation that may have been initially non-adaptive. 4. We end with suggestions on how future empirical studies can be designed to better test the importance of different kinds of plasticity to adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {Population cycles in small mammals have attracted the attention of several generations of theoretical and experimental biologists and continue to generate controversy. Top-down and bottom-up trophic regulations are two recent competing hypotheses. The principal purpose of this paper is to explore the relative contributions of a variety of ecological factors to predator--prey population cycles. Here we suggest that for some species -- collared lemmings, snowshoe hares and moose in particular -- maturation delay of predators and the functional response of predation appear to be the primary determinants. Our study suggests that maturation delay alone almost completely determines the cycle period, whereas the functional response greatly affects its amplitude and even its existence. These results are obtained from sensitivity analysis of all parameters in a mathematical model of the lemming--stoat delayed system, which is an extension of Gilg's model. Our result may also explain why lemmings have a 4-year cycle whereas snowshoe hares have a 10-year cycle. Our parameterized model supports and extends May's assertion that time delay impacts cycle period and amplitude. Furthermore, if maturation periods of predators are too short or too long, or the functional response resembles Holling Type I, then population cycles do not appear; however, suitable intermediate predator maturation periods and suitable functional responses can generate population cycles for both prey and predators. These results seem to explain why some populations are cyclic whereas others are not. Finally, we find parameterizations of our model that generate a 38-year population cycle consistent with the putative cycles of the moose--wolf interactions on Isle Royale, Michigan.},

Robinson et al (2008) examine cougar populations in a small, heavily-managed area of Washington State. They found that hunting of cougars only led to the habitat being more suitable (less density) and nearby cougars dispersed into the area. Using Leslie matrix models, the authors determined the population should be declining with the amount of reported hunting. However, the population had an observed growth rate close to one, implying that animals had to be dispersing into the site. This turned the site into a “sink” population that has to be supported by immigration in order to persist. I thought this was a pretty creative use of matrix models. I also liked how they used both deterministic and stochastic growth rates.

abstract = {Introductions of nonnative salmonids, such as rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta, have affected native fishes worldwide in unforeseen and undesirable ways. Predation and other interactions with nonnative rainbow trout and brown trout have been hypothesized as contributing to the decline of native fishes (including the endangered humpback chub Gila cypha) in the Colorado River, Grand Canyon. A multiyear study was conducted to remove nonnative fish from a 15-km segment of the Colorado River near the Little Colorado River confluence. We evaluated how sediment, temperature, fish prey availability, and predator abundance influenced the incidence of piscivory (IP) by nonnative salmonids. Study objectives were addressed through spatial (upstream and downstream of the Little Colorado River confluence) and temporal (seasonal and annual) comparisons of prey availability and predator abundance. Data were then evaluated by modeling the quantity of fish prey ingested by trout during the first 2 years (2003–2004) of the mechanical removal period. Field effort resulted in the capture of 20,000 nonnative fish, of which 90{\%} were salmonids. Results indicated that the brown trout IP was higher (8–70{\%}) than the rainbow trout IP (0.5–3.3{\%}); however, rainbow trout were 50 times more abundant than brown trout in the study area. We estimated that during the study period, over 30,000 fish (native and nonnative species combined) were consumed by rainbow trout (21,641 fish) and brown trout (11,797 fish). On average, rainbow trout and brown trout ingested 85{\%} more native fish than nonnative fish in spite of the fact that native fish constituted less than 30{\%} of the small fish available in the study area. Turbidity may mediate piscivory directly by reducing prey detection, but this effect was not apparent in our data, as rainbow trout IP was greater when suspended sediment levels (range = 5.9–20,000 mg/L) were higher.},

abstract = {Genomic resources for hundreds of species of evolutionary, agricultural, economic, and medical importance are unavailable due to the expense of well-assembled genome sequences and difficulties with multigenerational studies. Teleost fish provide many models for human disease but possess anciently duplicated genomes that sometimes obfuscate connectivity. Genomic information representing a fish lineage that diverged before the teleost genome duplication (TGD) would provide an outgroup for exploring the mechanisms of evolution after whole-genome duplication. We exploited massively parallel DNA sequencing to develop meiotic maps with thrift and speed by genotyping F(1) offspring of a single female and a single male spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) collected directly from nature utilizing only polymorphisms existing in these two wild individuals. Using Stacks, software that automates the calling of genotypes from polymorphisms assayed by Illumina sequencing, we constructed a map containing 8406 markers. RNA-seq on two map-cross larvae provided a reference transcriptome that identified nearly 1000 mapped protein-coding markers and allowed genome-wide analysis of conserved synteny. Results showed that the gar lineage diverged from teleosts before the TGD and its genome is organized more similarly to that of humans than teleosts. Thus, spotted gar provides a critical link between medical models in teleost fish, to which gar is biologically similar, and humans, to which gar is genomically similar. Application of our F(1) dense mapping strategy to species with no prior genome information promises to facilitate comparative genomics and provide a scaffold for ordering the numerous contigs arising from next generation genome sequencing.},
annote = {Science:


This study attempts to study Spotted Gar and it's role as an outgrpup for telosts, which are important for medical research. Ancient duplicated genomes in teleost fish make it difficult to interpret trends in its genome. Gar diverged before this whole-genome duplication in telost so they provide a suitable outgroup. The authors genotyped first generation offspring of a single mated pair of gar. They use DNA sequencing to create meiotic maps. This sequencing revealed that gar did in fact diverage prior to that genome duplication. This makes Gar more closely related to humans than telost and provide a useful genetic link. They also tested the idea of whole-genome duplicationis important in syntenic rearrangements. They were not able to rule out this hypothesis because there was a coservation of synteny between the human and gar genomes. 






Technology:
About 100 first generation fish were selected for genotyping (a lot of genetic material was needed)- each provided about a million sequences. Rad-tag libraries were sequenced using Illumina technology. A bioinformatics program differentiated between true SNPs or sequencing errors. In ambigious cases, reads were simply thrown out. This may cause issues if the ambigous reads were not randomly assorted in the genome and there was some important reason they appeared ambigious. There method was a lot cheaper than other approaches, but whole genome sequencing may be better in the future if the price continues to decline.},

abstract = {Understanding under what conditions populations, whether they be plants, animals or viral particles, persist is an issue of theoretical and practical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt persistence. One approach to examining the interplay between these deterministic and stochastic forces is the construction and analysis of stochastic difference equations X t+1 = F(X t, $\xi$ t+1), where X t $\epsilon$ R $\kappa$ represents the state of the populations and $\xi$ 1, $\xi$ 2,... is a sequence of random variables representing environmental stochasticity. In the analysis of these stochastic models, many theoretical population biologists are interested in whether the models are bounded and persistent. Here, boundedness asserts that asymptotically X t tends to remain in compact sets. In contrast, persistence requires that X t tends to be 'repelled' by some 'extinction set' S 0 ⊂ R $\kappa$. Here, results on both of these proprieties are reviewed for single species, multiple species and structured population models. The results are illustrated with applications to stochastic versions of the Hassell and Ricker single species models, Ricker, Beverton-Holt, lottery models of competition, and lottery models of rock-paper-scissor games. A variety of conjectures and suggestions for future research are presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Goals of the review were to evaluate the state of knowledge of bycatch and the role of existing protective legislation in shaping bycatch management for different taxa. Pressing issues are identified, as well as knowledge gaps and policy limitations that hinder multi-species bycatch reduction. The USA has made important progress toward reducing bycatch in its fisheries, but the efficacy of its management has been limited somewhat by a focus on taxon- and fishery-specific regulation and the lack of consistent mandate across taxa for taking a cumulative perspective on bycatch. Applying consistent criteria across taxa for setting bycatch limits (e.g., extending the approach used for marine mammals to sea turtles and seabirds) would be the first step in a multi-species approach to bycatch reduction. A population-based multi- species multi-gear approach to bycatch would help identify priority areas where resources are needed most and can be used most effectively.},

abstract = {Counterintuitive dynamics of various biological phenomena occur when composite system dynamics differ qualitatively from that of their component systems. Such composite systems typically arise when modelling situations with time-varying biotic or abiotic conditions, and examples range from metapopulation dynamics to population genetic models. These biological, and related physical, phenomena can often be modelled as simple financial games, wherein capital is gained and lost through gambling. Such games have been developed and used as heuristic devices to elucidate the processes at work in generating seemingly paradoxical outcomes across a spectrum of disciplines, albeit in a field-specific, ad hoc fashion. Here, we propose that studying these simple games can provide a much deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing paradoxical behaviours in models from a diversity of topics in evolution and ecology in which fluctuating environmental effects, whether deterministic or stochastic, are an essential aspect of the phenomenon of interest. Of particular note, we find that, for a broad class of models, the ecological concept of equilibrium reactivity provides an intuitive necessary condition that must be satisfied in order for environmental variability to promote population persistence. We contend that further investigations along these lines promise to unify aspects of the study of a range of topics, bringing questions from genetics, species persistence and coexistence and the evolution of bet-hedging strategies, under a common theoretical purview.},

abstract = {Abstract.---Leslie matrices and life tables are demographic models commonly used to evaluate the ability of specific elasmobranch life history strategies to sustain given levels and patterns of fishing pressure. These models are generally density independent and provide an instantaneous rate of population growth for a specified set of life history traits that correspond to a specific population size. Many investigators are using these models to compute rates of population growth that they claim are estimates of the maximum population growth rate (rintrinsic); they then use these estimates to compute purported estimates of maximum sustainable fishing mortality. However, neither a Leslie matrix nor a life table can be used to estimate rintrinsic without additional information, except in the special case where a severely depleted population is modeled. Only in a severely depleted population will competition for resources be at a minimum and both density-dependent compensation and the rate of population growth be at a maximum (i.e., at rintrinsic). The fundamental problem is to determine the life history parameters that would occur if the population were extremely depleted because extensive observations on extremely depleted populations are rare. In the absence of such data, rintrinsic can only be estimated from these types of density-independent models by extrapolating observed population growth rates toward zero population size. We illustrate the problems in, and describe methods for, estimating rintrinsic and present information on two species of elasmobranch: barndoor skate Dipturus laevis and lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris.},

abstract = {Meta-analyses of stock assessments can provide novel insight into marine population dynamics and the status of fished species, but the world's main stock assessment database (the Myers Stock-Recruitment Database) is now outdated. To facilitate new analyses, we developed a new database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality and catch/landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families), including nine of the world's 10 largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions, and include the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested fish taxa (16{\%}), and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1{\%}), but provide high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58{\%} of stocks with reference points (n = 214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and 30{\%} had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and fishery management, and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists.},

2) more often updated
3) geographic locations, type of assessment model, original data for different stocks worldwide
4) includes biological reference points and stock-specific life history parameters

Database core (output of population dynamics models, except total catch):
-vert and invert populations with time series of spawning stock biomass, total biomass, recruits, total catch/landings, and fishing mortality
-also BRPs, life history information
-geographic and taxonomic information for each stock

abstract = {Population persistence in a new and stressful environment can be influenced by the plastic phenotypic responses of individuals to this environment, and by the genetic evolution of plasticity itself. This process has recently been investigated theoretically, but testing the quantitative predictions in the wild is challenging because (i) there are usually not enough population replicates to deal with the stochasticity of the evolutionary process, (ii) environmental conditions are not controlled, and (iii) measuring selection and the inheritance of traits affecting fitness is difficult in natural populations. As an alternative, predictions from theory can be tested in the laboratory with controlled experiments. To illustrate the feasibility of this approach, we briefly review the literature on the experimental evolution of plasticity, and on evolutionary rescue in the laboratory, paying particular attention to differences and similarities between microbes and multicellular eukaryotes. We then highlight a set of questions that could be addressed using this framework, which would enable testing the robustness of theoretical predictions, and provide new insights into areas that have received little theoretical attention to date.},

abstract = {Coral resilience is important for withstanding ecological disturbances as well as anthropogenic changes to the environment. However, the last several decades have demonstrated a decline in resilience that has often resulted in phase shifts to a degraded coral-depleted state with high levels of algal abundance. A major defining issue in current research is to identify when and how it is possible to reverse these phase shifts allowing for the ecosystem to escape coral depletion and maintain coral-based ecosystem services. We extend an analytic model to focus on the effects of over-harvesting of herbivorous reef fish in the Caribbean by explicitly including grazer dynamics which introduces feedbacks between habitat and grazer abundance posing constraints on management options excluded in previous studies. This allows us to develop ecosystem-based management recommendations for two distinct scenarios of coral reef recovery: The first follows significant habitat damage in response to a large disturbance and the second maintains reef structure but has suffered from events such as coral bleaching. We identify critical fishing effort levels to allow for coral recovery and demonstrate that regions exhibiting severe damage to reef structure have little resilience implying that fishing reductions should be coupled with other restoration methods. Regions that are coral-depleted but maintain reef structure allow for recovery given sufficiently small levels of fishing mortality. However, we demonstrate the difference in recovery time in response to varying levels of control efforts on fishing. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society, a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation. Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.},
annote = {In ecology, the portfolio effect refers to the notion that stability would increase in a more species-rich community because variance in population size of different species would level out. However, the portfolio effect has rarely been examined within an individual species contet. This could be at a population, indivudal, or genetic level. In this study, the authors examine a number of different salmon stocks of the same species. They find that individual stocks are much less stable than the entire population. They found that if the stocks were examined as a single group variability would be 2.2 times lower than when they are managed per stock.

abstract = {1. Demographic analysis is essential in order to determine which factors, such as survival, fertility and other life-history characteristics, have the greatest influence on a population's rate of growth (lambda). 2. We used life-table response experiments (LTREs) to assess the relative importance of survival and fertility rates for an alpine lagomorph, the collared pika Ochotona collaris, using 12 years (1995-2006) of census data. The LTRE analysis was repeated for each of three subpopulations within the main study site that were defined by aspect (east, west and south). 3. Across the entire study site, the survival and fertility of adults contributed 35.6 and 43.5{\%}, respectively, to the variance observed in the projected population growth rate, V(lambda), whereas juvenile survival contributed 20.9{\%}. Adult survival and fertility contributed approximately equal amounts for each subpopulation when considered separately, although their rank order varied spatially. 4. Adult survival across the entire site was positively correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) with a time lag of 1 year, and was uncorrelated to adult density. The PDO was negatively correlated to the timing of spring snowmelt at our site, implicating the importance of earlier spring conditions and plant phenology on the subsequent winter survival of adults and therefore, population growth. 5. When subpopulations were analysed separately, survivals and fertilities were variously correlated to lagged PDO and adult densities, but the patterns varied spatially. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying V(lambda) can vary substantially over relatively short distances.},

The management of the suite of threats to the health of the reef has clearly been inadequate, even though there have been several notable successes. It is argued that the failure to prioritise correctly all major threats to the reef, coupled with the exaggeration of the benefits of calling the park a protected area and zoning subsets of areas as 'no-take', has distracted attention from adequately addressing the real causes of impact. Australia's marine conservation efforts have been dominated by commitment to a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. In so doing, Australia has displaced the internationally accepted primary priority for pursuing effective protection of marine environments with inadequately critical adherence to the principle of having more and bigger marine parks.

abstract = {Classifying species according to their risk of extinction is a common practice and underpins much conservation activity. The reliability of such classifications rests on the accuracy of threat categorizations, but very little is known about the magnitude and types of errors that might be expected. The process of risk classification involves combining information from many sources, and understanding the quality of each source is critical to evaluating the overall status of the species. One common criterion used to classify extinction risk is a decline in abundance. Because abundance is a direct measure of conservation status, counts of individuals are generally the preferred method of evaluating whether populations are declining. Using the thresholds from criterion A of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (critically endangered, decline in abundance of {\textgreater}80{\%} over 10 years or 3 generations; endangered, decline in abundance of 50-80{\%}; vulnerable, decline in abundance of 30-50{\%}; least concern or near threatened, decline in abundance of 0-30{\%}), we assessed 3 methods used to detect declines solely from estimates of abundance: use of just 2 estimates of abundance; use of linear regression on a time series of abundance; and use of state-space models on a time series of abundance. We generated simulation data from empirical estimates of the typical variability in abundance and assessed the 3 methods for classification errors. The estimates of the proportion of falsely detected declines for linear regression and the state-space models were low (maximum 3-14{\%}), but 33-75{\%} of small declines (30-50{\%} over 15 years) were not detected. Ignoring uncertainty in estimates of abundance (with just 2 estimates of abundance) allowed more power to detect small declines (95{\%}), but there was a high percentage (50{\%}) of false detections. For all 3 methods, the proportion of declines estimated to be {\textgreater}80{\%} was higher than the true proportion. Use of abundance data to detect species at risk of extinction may either fail to detect initial declines in abundance or have a high error rate.},

abstract = {Uniting frameworks used by Hamilton and May (1977), Levin et al. (1984) and Ezoe (1998), we show that the problem of the evolution of seed size - or of any other single dispersal-determining trait - can, under certain conditions, be understood as a constrained optimization problem. We find a function, F, whose maxima represent convergence stable strategies - evolutionary attractors towards which selection will drive populations (given sufficient diversity of types, either initially or generated through mutation). This function has a nice interpretation as the product of competitive ability and fecundity (both squared) and a functional describing the spread of the dispersal kernel. Using ideas pioneered by Dan Cohen and the theory of adaptive dynamics, we explore the consequences for the evolution of dispersal and seed size in populations, focusing on examples in metapopulations, with some comments on more general spatial models.},

abstract = {The role of local habitat geometry (habitat area and isolation) in predicting species distribution has become an increasingly more important issue, because habitat loss and fragmentation cause species range contraction and extinction. However, it has also become clear that other factors, in particular regional factors (environmental stochasticity and regional population dynamics), should be taken into account when predicting colonisation and extinction. In a live trapping study of a mainland-island metapopulation of the root vole (Microtus oeconomus) we found extensive occupancy dynamics across 15 riparian islands, but yet an overall balance between colonisation and extinction over 4 years. The 54 live trapping surveys conducted over 13 seasons revealed imperfect detection and proxies of population density had to be included in robust design, multi-season occupancy models to achieve unbiased rate estimates. Island colonisation probability was parsimoniously predicted by the multi-annual density fluctuations of the regional mainland population and local island habitat quality, while extinction probability was predicted by island population density and the level of the recent flooding events (the latter being the main regionalized disturbance regime in the study system). Island size and isolation had no additional predictive power and thus such local geometric habitat characteristics may be overrated as predictors of vole habitat occupancy relative to measures of local habitat quality. Our results suggest also that dynamic features of the larger region and/or the metapopulation as a whole, owing to spatially correlated environmental stochasticity and/or biotic interactions, may rule the colonisation-extinction dynamics of boreal vole metapopulations. Due to high capacities for dispersal and habitat tracking voles originating from large source populations can rapidly colonise remote and small high quality habitat patches and re-establish populations that have gone extinct due to demographic (small population size) and environmental stochasticity (e.g. extreme climate events).},

abstract = {Habitat loss reduces species diversity, but the effect of habitat fragmentation on number of species is less clear because fragmentation generally accompanies loss of habitat. We compared four methods that aim to decouple the effects of fragmentation from the effects of habitat loss. Two methods are based on species-area relations, one on Fisher's alpha index of diversity, and one on plots of cumulative number of species detected against cumulative area sampled. We used these methods to analyze the species diversity of spiders in 2, 3.2 × 4 km agricultural landscapes in Southern Judea Lowlands, Israel. Spider diversity increased as fragmentation increased with all four methods, probably not because of the additive within-patch processes, such as edge effect and heterogeneity. The positive relation between fragmentation and species diversity might reflect that most species can disperse through the fields during the wheat-growing season. We suggest that if a given area was designated for the conservation of spiders in Southern Judea Lowlands, Israel, a set of several small patches may maximize species diversity over time.},

abstract = {Data on several marine species collected over 15 years (1991 to 2007), by dive-masters of the diving company Undersea Hunter, at 27 sites around Isla del Coco (Cocos Island), Pacific Costa Rica, were analyzed. The goal was to create a base line of the pelagic species that live in the waters of the Island based on reports of their activity during tourist dives. A data matrix was generated and multivariate methods used to determine the patterns of temporal and spacial variation. variability in the occurrence of several species was high between sites. All sites presented a change in the asemblages during the 1991-92 and 1997-98 El Niño events. However, some sites had more influence by this climatic oscillation. El Niño event had stronger repercussion on the abundance and occurrence of particular species. Elasmobranchs such as the scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and the marbled ray (Taeniura meyeni) showed a negative association with anomalous sea surface temperatures. Starting in 2000 there is a decrease in the average abundances and in the presence of the pelagic species, especially for economically important sharks. These variables reach similar values compared to those of El Niño years. A possible explanation is the increase of illegal fishing that took place around the Island or immediate waters. Some of these are species with great mobility. Nevertheless, some species had a small recovery in recent years. A collaborative program between the Government of Costa Rica and Marviva (a non governmental organization) in recent years has resulted in an improvement in the conservation of the marine fauna of Isla del Coco.

We can prepare for and manage these emergencies through improved surveillance, and the development and iterative refinement of approaches to mitigate disease and its impacts. Improving surveillance requires fast, accurate diagnoses, forecasting disease risk and real-time monitoring of disease-promoting environmental conditions. Diversifying impact mitigation involves increasing host resilience to disease, reducing pathogen abundance and managing environmental factors that facilitate disease. Disease surveillance and mitigation can be adaptive if informed by research advances and catalysed by communication among observers, researchers and decision-makers using information-sharing platforms. Recent increases in the awareness of the threats posed by marine diseases may lead to policy frameworks that facilitate the responses and management that marine disease emergencies require.},

abstract = {The study and implementation of no-take marine reserves have increased rapidly over the past decade, providing ample data on the biological effects of reserve protection for a wide range of geographic locations and organisms. The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to re- evaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data synthe- ses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably simi- lar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made asser- tions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of lati- tude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set—variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, par- ticularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools},

abstract = {The production of offspring by vertebrates is often timed to coincide with the annual peak in resource availability. However, capital breeders can extend the energetic benefits of a resource pulse by storing food or fat, thus relaxing the need for synchrony between energy supply and demand. Food-hoarding red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) breeding in the boreal forest are reliant on cones from a masting conifer for their nutrition, yet lactation is typically completed before the annual crop of cones is available for consumption such that peaks in energy supply and demand are not synchronized. We investigated the phenological response of red squirrels to annual variation in environmental conditions over a 20-year span and examined how intra- and inter-annual variation in the timing of reproduction affected offspring recruitment. Reproductive phenology was strongly affected by past resource availability with offspring born earlier in years following large cone crops, presumably because this affected the amount of capital available for reproduction. Early breeders had higher offspring survival and were more likely to renest following early litter loss when population density was high, perhaps because late-born offspring are less competitive in obtaining a territory when vacancies are limited. Early breeders were also more likely to renest after successfully weaning their first litter, but renesting predominantly occurred during mast years. Because of their increased propensity to renest and the higher survival rates of their offspring, early breeders contribute more recruits to the population but the advantage of early breeding depends on population density and resource availability.},

A public-private partnership (the MLPA Initiative) completed four regional public MPA planning processes characterized by robust stakeholder contributions and the incorporation of best readily available science. Prior to enactment of the MLPA in 1999, less than 3{\%} of California state waters were in MPAs, and most of those MPAs were small and lacked clear objectives. By 2013, approximately 16{\%} of state waters will be in 124 MPAs that represent and replicate most marine and estuarine habitats and are designed to be ecologically-connected. The redesigned statewide network of MPAs improves marine ecosystem protection in California, advanced the science and practice of designing MPA networks, and increased the awareness and capacity of stakeholders, scientists and decision-makers for marine spatial planning. The public planning effort took almost seven years and significant financial investment (approximately {\$}19.5 million in private charitable foundation funds and {\$}18.5 million in public funds). Not all stakeholders were pleased with the outcomes and the planning processes faced many challenges. While the design of the MPA network aimed to meet science and feasibility guidelines, final decisions on MPAs in each region reflected tradeoffs needed to garner public acceptance and support for implementation. The MLPA Initiative offers some key lessons about implementing policy through a public planning process. While California is developing mechanisms for assessing effectiveness of the MPA network in coming years, including establishing a MPA Monitoring Enterprise and a process for periodic review and adaptive management of MPAs, significant challenges remain for effective implementation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The new Canid Action Plan synthesises the current knowledge on the biology, ecology and status of all wild canid species, and outlines the conservation actions and projects needed to secure their long-term survival. Aiming at conservation biologists, ecologists, local conservation officials, administrators, educators, and all others dealing with canids in their jobs, the authors aspire to stimulate the conservation of all canids by highlighting problems, debating priorities and suggesting action. The 36 taxa of wild canids that comprise the family Canidae, ranging in size from the tiny fennec fox to the mighty grey wolf, and found in every continent except Antarctica, are special. They are special because they have, as perceived friend or foe, preoccupied the imaginations of mankind for millennia; because the breadth of their adaptations makes them enthralling to science; and because the contradictory facets of their relations with people perplex the conservationist. The increase in numbers of people, the spread of settlement, and the exploitation of natural resources of previously little-disturbed wild lands, together with persecution, are threatening some of these canids with extinction. The possibility that we are heedlessly, perhaps needlessly, mismanaging many of them is saddening; the probability that our negligence will force several more to extinction should fill us with bottomless dismay. It demands action, and that is why we have compiled this new Canid Action Plan. Following a short introduction and a chapter on phylogeny, classification, and evolutionary ecology of the Canidae (Part 1), Part 2 provides the latest information on the distribution, biology and conservation status of each species, organised by geographical region. The accounts also list current field projects, and their contact details are provided in an appendix. The Canid Specialist Groups members are active worldwide. Nine of the 36 taxa covered are threatened (3 Critically Endangered, 3 Endangered and 3 Vulnerable), and one is considered Near Threatened. Six species (7{\%}) were listed as Data Deficient, and 20 (56{\%}) species as Least Concern (Appendix 1). The threatened canids are: Darwins fox (CR). Until recently, known only from the Island of Chilo (Chile) until rediscovered 600km away in the coastal mountains, where domestic dogs threaten them with disease or direct attack. Red wolf (CR). Currently the subject of taxonomic debate, red wolves were declared Extinct in the Wild by 1980, but have been reintroduced into eastern North Carolina, where they are now locally common. Hybridisation with coyotes is the primary threat. Island fox (CR). Restricted to the six largest of the eight California Channel Islands, each island population is considered a separate subspecies, and four have declined precipitously. Threats include hyperpredation by golden eagles and the introduction of canine diseases. Ethiopian wolf (EN). Less than 500 individuals remain, confined to eight locations in the Ethiopian Highlands. Previously listed as Critically Endangered, continuous loss of habitat due to high-altitude subsistence agriculture remains the major threat, along with disease (particularly rabies). African wild dog (EN). Formerly distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, excluding rainforests, wild dogs have disappeared from 25 of the former 39 range states. More than half of the mortality recorded among adults is caused directly by human activity. Dhole (EN). Formerly distributed across Asia, dholes have undergone widespread decline and are threatened by depletion of their prey base, habitat loss, persecution, competition and disease. Dingo (VU). Austronesian people transported the dingo from Asia to Australia and other islands in between 1,000 and 5,000 years ago. Pure dingoes occur only as remnant populations in central and northern Australia and in Thailand, and they are threatened by cross-breeding with domestic dogs. Bush dog (VU). Despite a supposedly widespread distribution in South American forests, this species is perceived as rare, and threatened by habitat conversion and human encroachment. Blanfords fox (VU). Present in arid mountainous regions of the Middle East and north-eastern Egypt eastwards to Afghanistan, where human development could pose a threat. In contrast to the threats faced by threatened canids, several species are thriving in human-dominated landscapes and incur the loathing of farmers and hunters alike. Red foxes are notoriously successful in urban settings, and coyotes, golden jackals, crab-eating and kit foxes seem able to thrive amidst human settlements. Management prompted by rabies control, fur harvest, and livestock predation leads to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of canids annually. Part 3 of the Plan considers nine major issues in canid conservation, namely canid society, conservation genetics, assessing and managing diseases, management of canids near people, impact of exploitation and trade, survey and census techniques, captive conservation, reintroduction and metapopulation management, and conservation education. Part 4 is arguably the most important section. It includes a chapter on the need for setting priorities and measuring success in canid conservation, and the detailed Action Plan for canid conservation into the 21st century. Although we have sought to refine and consolidate these entries, they represent the views of the many experts around the world who suggested them, who debated them in our workshops and in the forum of our international congress, hosted by the WildCRU in Oxford in September 2001. The list of proposed projects makes no claim to be comprehensive, but it is the result of extremely wide consultation. The plan itself, together with the databases concerning existing members and research projects, are all available on the web at http://www.canids.org. The Action Plan was prepared in parallel with our edited monograph entitled The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids (Oxford University Press, 2004) which contains comprehensive reviews of the science underpinning this Action Plan, together with 14 case studies of wild canid biology.
