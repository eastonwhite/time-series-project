European rabbits are present in most of Europe, North Africa, parts of South America, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in more than 800 islands, where they occupy a huge variety of ecosystems (Thompson and King 1994). Its domestic counterpart exhibits a remarkable variety of breeds showing variation in colour, size and fertility. Domestic breeds are kept and raised globally for meat, wool and fur, and also as increasing popular pets. However, for most of its history, the European rabbit was confined to the Iberian Peninsula where the species is supposed to have emerged in the mid-Pleistocene. We know this from the analysis of the fossil record that in addition, places also in the Iberian Peninsula the emergence of genus Oryctolagus (Lopez-Martinez 2008, this book). The subsequent geographical expansion and successful colonization of multiple territories is as recent as historical times and has been mostly human-mediated. This expansion eventually ended in a domestication process that is unique to Western Europe.},

abstract = {Classifying species according to their risk of extinction is a common practice and underpins much conservation activity. The reliability of such classifications rests on the accuracy of threat categorizations, but very little is known about the magnitude and types of errors that might be expected. The process of risk classification involves combining information from many sources, and understanding the quality of each source is critical to evaluating the overall status of the species. One common criterion used to classify extinction risk is a decline in abundance. Because abundance is a direct measure of conservation status, counts of individuals are generally the preferred method of evaluating whether populations are declining. Using the thresholds from criterion A of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (critically endangered, decline in abundance of {\textgreater}80{\%} over 10 years or 3 generations; endangered, decline in abundance of 50-80{\%}; vulnerable, decline in abundance of 30-50{\%}; least concern or near threatened, decline in abundance of 0-30{\%}), we assessed 3 methods used to detect declines solely from estimates of abundance: use of just 2 estimates of abundance; use of linear regression on a time series of abundance; and use of state-space models on a time series of abundance. We generated simulation data from empirical estimates of the typical variability in abundance and assessed the 3 methods for classification errors. The estimates of the proportion of falsely detected declines for linear regression and the state-space models were low (maximum 3-14{\%}), but 33-75{\%} of small declines (30-50{\%} over 15 years) were not detected. Ignoring uncertainty in estimates of abundance (with just 2 estimates of abundance) allowed more power to detect small declines (95{\%}), but there was a high percentage (50{\%}) of false detections. For all 3 methods, the proportion of declines estimated to be {\textgreater}80{\%} was higher than the true proportion. Use of abundance data to detect species at risk of extinction may either fail to detect initial declines in abundance or have a high error rate.},

abstract = {Estimating temporal trends in spatially structured populations has a critical role to play in understanding regional changes in biological populations and developing management strategies. Designing effective monitoring programmes to estimate these trends requires important decisions to be made about how to allocate sampling effort among spatial replicates (i.e. number of sites) and temporal replicates (i.e. how often to survey) to minimise uncertainty in trend estimates. In particular, the optimal mix of spatial and temporal replicates is likely to depend upon the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics. Although there has been considerable interest in the ecological literature on understanding spatial and temporal correlations in species' population dynamics, little attention has been paid to its consequences for monitoring design. We address this issue using model-based survey design to identify the optimal allocation of sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates for estimating population trends under different levels of spatial and temporal correlation. Based on linear trends, we show that how we should allocate sampling effort among spatial and temporal replicates depends crucially on the spatial and temporal correlations in population dynamics, environmental variation, observation error and the spatial variation in temporal trends. When spatial correlation is low and temporal correlation is high, the best option is likely to be to sample many sites infrequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are high. When spatial correlation is high and temporal correlation is low, the best option is likely to be to sample few sites frequently, particularly when observation error and/or spatial variation in temporal trends are low. When abundances are spatially independent, it is always preferable to maximise spatial replication. This provides important insights into how spatio-temporal monitoring programmes should be designed to estimate temporal trends in spatially structured populations.},

abstract = {Assessments of extinction risk based on population declines are widely used, yet scientists have little quantitative understanding of their reliability. Incorrectly classifying whether a population is declining or not can lead to inappropriate conservation actions or management measures, with potentially profound societal costs. Here we evaluate key causes of misclassification of decline status and assess the reliability of 20 decline metrics using a stochastic model to simulate time series of population abundance of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We show that between-year variability in population productivity (process variation) and, to a lesser extent, variability in abundance estimates (observation error) are important causes of unreliable identification of population status. We found that using all available data, rather than just the most recent three generations, consistently improved the reliability of risk assessments. The approach outlined here can improve understanding of the reliability of risk assessments, thereby reducing concerns that may impede their use for exploited taxa such as marine fishes.

abstract = {The ability to detect trends in population abundance is of obvious interest to wildlife managers. In recent years, the probability of detecting defined population trends has been the most common method of assessing monitoring programs. Such analyses require many assumptions, including a model for population change and a model for variance. To demonstrate potential effects of these assumptions on power analysis results, we present data for Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) from Tern Island, Hawaii. Depending on our assumptions, the power to detect a 50{\%} decline over 10 years varied from 80{\%} to 100{\%}. We argue that monitoring standards based upon the ability to detect population trends should be applied cautiously. As a complementary approach, we propose that monitoring standards should emphasize attributes of sampling design that increase precision (e.g., randomization, bias, and detection probability). By using standards of precision, managers can focus on the sources of variation that can be minimized. A sampling design approach to monitoring standards provides a useful complement to standards of statistical power to detect annual trends.},

abstract = {Although there are many indicators of endangerment (i.e., whether populations or species meet criteria that justify conservation action), their reliability has rarely been tested. Such indicators may fail to identify that a population or species meets criteria for conservation action (false negative) or may incorrectly show that such criteria have been met (false positive). To quantify the rate of both types of error for 20 commonly used indicators of declining abundance (threat indicators), we used receiver operating characteristic curves derived from historical (1938-2007) data for 18 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations in the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. We retrospectively determined each population's yearly status (reflected by change in abundance over time) on the basis of each indicator. We then compared that population's status in a given year with the status in subsequent years (determined by the magnitude of decline in abundance across those years). For each sockeye population, we calculated how often each indicator of past status matched subsequent status. No single threat indicator provided error-free estimates of status, but indicators that reflected the extent (i.e., magnitude) of past decline in abundance (through comparison of current abundance with some historical baseline abundance) tended to better reflect status in subsequent years than the rate of decline over the previous 3 generations (a widely used indicator). We recommend that when possible, the reliability of various threat indicators be evaluated with empirical analyses before such indicators are used to determine the need for conservation action. These indicators should include estimates from the entire data set to take into account a historical baseline.},

abstract = {* ‘Will my study answer my research question?' is the most fundamental question a researcher can ask when designing a study, yet when phrased in statistical terms – ‘What is the power of my study?' or ‘How precise will my parameter estimate be?' – few researchers in ecology and evolution (EE) try to answer it, despite the detrimental consequences of performing under- or over-powered research. We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the ‘informativeness' of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions. * We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs. * Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly. * These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},
